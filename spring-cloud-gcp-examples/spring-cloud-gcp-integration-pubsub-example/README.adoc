= Spring Integration Channel Adapters for Google Cloud Pub/Sub Code Sample

This code sample contains a couple of apps.
One app gets a message provided by the user through a webpage and publishes it to a Google Cloud
Pub/Sub topic.
The other app subscribes to that topic and logs received messages.

== Setup & Configuration

1. Configure your GCP project ID and credentials by following
link:../../spring-cloud-gcp-starters/spring-cloud-gcp-starter-core[these instructions].
+
Alternatively, if you have the
https://cloud.google.com/sdk/[Google Cloud SDK] installed and initialized, and are logged in with
https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/application-default-credentials[application
default credentials], Spring will auto-discover those parameters for you.

2. Go to the https://console.cloud.google.com/cloudpubsub/topicList[Google Cloud Console Pub/Sub
topics page] and create a topic called `exampleTopic`.

3. Still in the same page, locate the newly created topic, click the button with the three vertical
dots at the end of the topic's line and click "New subscription".
Create a new subscription called `exampleSubscription` with all default parameters.

3. In separate terminal windows, start the
`spring-cloud-gcp-spring-integration-pubsub-example-sender` and
`spring-cloud-gcp-spring-integration-pubsub-example-receiver` applications with the
`mvn spring-boot:run` command in the same folder as the apps' `pom.xml` files.

4. Go to http://localhost:8080, write a message in the text box and hit the `Submit` button.

5. Verify that the receiver logged the message you wrote.
+
`Message arrived! Payload: [message-entered]`
