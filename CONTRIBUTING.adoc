= Code formatting guidelines

The directory src/eclipse has two files for use with code formatting, `eclipse-code-formatter.xml`
for the majority of the code formatting rules and `eclipse.importorder` to order the import
statements.

== Eclipse
Import these files by navigating `Windows -> Preferences` and then the menu items
`Preferences > Java > Code Style > Formatter` and `Preferences > Java > Code Style >
Organize Imports` respectively.

== IntelliJ IDEA
Install the plugin `Eclipse Code Formatter`. You can find it by searching in "Browse Repositories",
under `Settings > Plugins` within IDEA (Once installed, you will need to reboot IDEA for it to take
effect).

Then navigate to `Settings > Other Settings` (this might be under `Preferences` on Mac) and select
the Eclipse Code Formatter. Select the `eclipse-code-formatter.xml` file for the field `Eclipse Java
Formatter config file` and the file `eclipse.importorder` for the field `Import order`.
Enable the `Eclipse code formatter` by clicking `Use the Eclipse code formatter` radio button at the
top of the page, then click the *OK* button.

* NOTE: If you configure the `Eclipse Code Formatter` from `File > Other Settings > Default
Settings`, it will set this policy across all of your IDEA projects.

* IDEA's "Optimize imports on the fly" option turned on interferes with the Eclipse code formatter
import optimization. Consider disabling the option if optimization does not yield the expected
results.
