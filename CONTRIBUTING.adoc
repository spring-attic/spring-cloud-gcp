= Contributing to Spring Cloud GCP

We welcome contributions to Spring Cloud GCP.

== Building the Project

The first step to contributing is to fork the repository and clone it onto your machine.

1. Ensure you have Java version 8 or later installed on your machine.

2. Try running some tests.
+
Run `./mvnw clean test` in the root directory of the project to run the tests.
The `./mvnw` is a self-contained https://maven.apache.org/[Maven] wrapper that allows you to build the project without having Maven installed on your local machine.
+
You can run the tests of a specific module by using the `-f` flag like this: `./mvnw clean test -f spring-cloud-gcp-pubsub`
+
If you are contributing to a sample application, please use `full-checkstyle` maven profile to validate code style locally: `./mvnw clean test -P full-checkstyle`.

3. (Optional) Install the https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/[Google Cloud SDK].
The Google Cloud SDK a set of tools that you can use to manage resources and applications hosted on Google Cloud Platform.
+
For our purposes, it contains the `gcloud` command line tool which allows you to specify a GCP account and project with which you can run our integration tests and sample applications on your machine.
+
a. Run `gcloud auth application-default login` to log into your https://console.cloud.google.com[Google Cloud Platform account].
+
b. Run `gcloud config set project [YOUR_PROJECT_ID]` to set the GCP project ID you wish to use.
+
c. Verify your settings using `gcloud config list`.
This will display the account settings that will be used to authenticate with Google Cloud on your machine.
+
NOTE: These methods are recommended for local development only and not for production use.
It is recommended to use https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/service-accounts#whats_next[Service Accounts] for authentication in production applications.


== Code formatting guidelines

The directory src/eclipse has two files for use with code formatting, `eclipse-code-formatter.xml` for the majority of the code formatting rules and `eclipse.importorder` to order the import statements.

=== Eclipse
Import these files by navigating `Windows -> Preferences` and then the menu items
`Preferences > Java > Code Style > Formatter` and `Preferences > Java > Code Style >
Organize Imports` respectively.

=== IntelliJ IDEA
Install the plugin `Eclipse Code Formatter`.
You can find it by searching in "Browse Repositories", under `Settings > Plugins` within IDEA (Once installed, you will need to reboot IDEA for it to take effect).

Then navigate to `Settings > Other Settings` (this might be under `Preferences` on Mac) and select the Eclipse Code Formatter.
Select the `eclipse-code-formatter.xml` file for the field `Eclipse Java Formatter config file` and the file `eclipse.importorder` for the field `Import order`.
Enable the `Eclipse code formatter` by clicking `Use the Eclipse code formatter` radio button at the top of the page, then click the *OK* button.

* NOTE: If you configure the `Eclipse Code Formatter` from `File > Other Settings > Default Settings`, it will set this policy across all of your IDEA projects.

* IDEA's "Optimize imports on the fly" option turned on interferes with the Eclipse code formatter import optimization.
Consider disabling the option if optimization does not yield the expected results.

== Contributing a patch

1. Submit an issue describing your proposed change.

1. A repository owner will respond to your issue as soon as possible.

1. If your proposed change is accepted, and you haven't already done so, sign a
https://cla.pivotal.io/[Contributor License Agreement].

1. Fork the repository, develop and test your code changes.

1. Ensure that your code adheres to the
https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/wiki/Code-Style[Spring Style
Guide].

1. Ensure your code has an appropriate set of unit tests which all pass.

1. Make sure all new or modified `java` files include the current year as the copyright range end.
The range start should always be `2017`:

 /*
  * Copyright 2017-YYYY the original author or authors.
  * ...
  */
+
To automatically fix the headers in uncommitted files, run the following script with no arguments:

 $ bash util/update-license-year.sh
+
To update already-committed files, pass a commit hash or a branch name to use as a baseline:

 $ bash util/update-license-year.sh master

1. Create a pull request with the proposed code change.
It will be approved and merged by a committer.
