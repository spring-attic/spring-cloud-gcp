= Spring Cloud GCP release process

The actual release process is triggered by the release admin.
In order to simplify that process, here is a list of prerequisites to be performed before asking the release admin to run the release scripts.

1. Comment out the `spring-cloud-gcp-samples` module from the root `pom.xml` file, so that the samples aren't released.

2. Comment out any non-GA modules from the `pom.xml` file.

3. Manually change the value of `TRACKING_HEADER_PROJECT_VERSION` in link:spring-cloud-gcp-core/src/main/java/org/springframework/cloud/gcp/core/UsageTrackingHeaderProvider.java[`UsageTrackingHeaderProvider`] to the version being released from the interim `BUILD-SNAPSHOT` value.

4. Change the value of the `<version>` elements of the `pom.xml` of each module in the project being released to the name of the version being released from the interim `BUILD-SNAPSHOT` values. This can be done manually or using the https://www.mojohaus.org/versions-maven-plugin/set-mojo.html[mvn versions:set] command.

After the release scripts have been run by the release admin, revert the version names from steps 3 and 4 to the interim `BUILD-SNAPSHOT` name.
