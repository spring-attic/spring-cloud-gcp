= Spring Cloud GCP release process

The actual release process is triggered by the release admin and happens together with the rest of the Spring Cloud release.
In order to simplify that process, here is a list of prerequisites to be performed before asking the release admin to run the release scripts.

. Ensure that modules that shouldn't be released have the `maven-deploy-plugin` configuration set to `<skip>true</skip>`.
For GA releases this should be configured under the `central` Maven profile.

	<build>
		<plugins>
			<plugin>
				<artifactId>maven-deploy-plugin</artifactId>
				<configuration>
					<skip>true</skip>
				</configuration>
			</plugin>
		</plugins>
	</build>

. Wait for the release scripts to have been run by the release admin.

. Make sure that the release tag was automatically added by the release process.

. Make sure that the link:https://github.com/spring-io/initializr/blob/master/initializr-service/src/main/resources/application.yml[Spring Boot Initializr] is updated to support the new version of Spring Cloud GCP.
