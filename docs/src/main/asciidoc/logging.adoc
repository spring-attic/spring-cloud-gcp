https://cloud.google.com/logging/[Stackdriver Logging] is the managed logging service provided by Google Cloud Platform.

This module provides support for associating a web request trace ID with the corresponding log entries.
It does so by retrieving the `X-B3-TraceId` value from the https://logback.qos.ch/manual/mdc.html[Mapped Diagnostic Context (MDC)], which is set by Spring Cloud Sleuth.
If Spring Cloud Sleuth isn't used, the configured `TraceIdExtractor` extracts the desired header value and sets it as the log entry's trace ID.
This allows grouping of log messages by request, for example, in the https://console.cloud.google.com/logs/viewer[Google Cloud Console Logs viewer].

NOTE: Due to the way logging is set up, the GCP project ID and credentials defined in `application.properties` are ignored.
Instead, you should set the `GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT` and `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` environment variables to the project ID and credentials private key location, respectively.
You can do this easily if you're using the https://cloud.google.com/sdk[Google Cloud SDK], using the `gcloud config set project [YOUR_PROJECT_ID]` and `gcloud auth application-default login` commands, respectively.

=== Web MVC Interceptor

For use in Web MVC-based applications, `TraceIdLoggingWebMvcInterceptor` is provided that extracts the request trace ID from an HTTP request using a `TraceIdExtractor` and stores it in a thread-local, which can then be used in a logging appender to add the trace ID metadata to log messages.

WARNING: If Spring Cloud GCP Trace is enabled, the logging module disables itself and delegates log correlation to Spring Cloud Sleuth.

`LoggingWebMvcConfigurer` configuration class is also provided to help register the `TraceIdLoggingWebMvcInterceptor` in Spring MVC applications.

Applications hosted on the Google Cloud Platform include trace IDs under the `x-cloud-trace-context` header, which will be included in log entries.
However, if Sleuth is used the trace ID will be picked up from the MDC.

=== Logback Support

Currently, only Logback is supported and there are 2 possibilities to log to Stackdriver via this library with Logback: via direct API calls and through JSON-formatted console logs.

==== Log via API
A Stackdriver appender is available using `org/springframework/cloud/gcp/logging/logback-appender.xml`.
This appender builds a Stackdriver Logging log entry from a JUL or Logback log entry, adds a trace ID to it and sends it to Stackdriver Logging.

`STACKDRIVER_LOG_NAME` and `STACKDRIVER_LOG_FLUSH_LEVEL` environment variables can be used to customize the `STACKDRIVER` appender.

Your configuration may then look like this:
[source, xml]
----
<configuration>
  <include resource="org/springframework/cloud/gcp/logging/logback-appender.xml" />

  <root level="INFO">
    <appender-ref ref="STACKDRIVER" />
  </root>
</configuration>
----

If you want to have more control over the log output, you can further configure the appender.
The following properties are available:

[options="header",]
|=======================================================================
| Property | Default Value | Description
| `log` | `spring.log` | The Stackdriver Log name.
This can also be set via the `STACKDRIVER_LOG_NAME` environmental variable.
| `flushLevel` | `WARN` | If a log entry with this level is encountered, trigger a flush of locally buffered log to Stackdriver Logging.
This can also be set via the `STACKDRIVER_LOG_FLUSH_LEVEL` environmental variable.
|=======================================================================


==== Log via Console

For Logback, a `org/springframework/cloud/gcp/logging/logback-json-appender.xml` file is made available for import to make it easier to configure the JSON Logback appender.

Your configuration may then look something like this:
[source, xml]
----
<configuration>
  <include resource="org/springframework/cloud/gcp/logging/logback-json-appender.xml" />

  <root level="INFO">
    <appender-ref ref="CONSOLE_JSON" />
  </root>
</configuration>
----

If your application is running on Google Kubernetes Engine, Google Compute Engine or Google App Engine Flexible, your console logging is automatically saved to Google Stackdriver Logging.
Therefore, you can just include `org/springframework/cloud/gcp/logging/logback-json-appender.xml` in your logging configuration, which logs JSON entries to the console.
The trace id will be set correctly.

If you want to have more control over the log output, you can further configure the appender.
The following properties are available:

[options="header",]
|=======================================================================
| Property | Default Value | Description
| `projectId`
a| If not set, default value is determined in the following order:

1. `SPRING_CLOUD_GCP_LOGGING_PROJECT_ID` Environmental Variable.
2. Value of `DefaultGcpProjectIdProvider.getProjectId()`
a| This is used to generate fully qualified Stackdriver Trace ID format: `projects/[PROJECT-ID]/traces/[TRACE-ID]`.

This format is required to correlate trace between Stackdriver Trace and Stackdriver Logging.

If `projectId` is not set and cannot be determined, then it'll log `traceId` without the fully qualified format.
| `includeTraceId` | `true` | Should the `traceId` be included
| `includeSpanId` | `true` | Should the `spanId` be included
| `includeLevel` | `true` | Should the severity be included
| `includeThreadName` | `true` | Should the thread name be included
| `includeMDC` | `true` | Should all MDC properties be included.
The MDC properties `X-B3-TraceId`, `X-B3-SpanId` and `X-Span-Export` provided by Spring Sleuth will get excluded as they get handled separately
| `includeLoggerName` | `true` | Should the name of the logger be included
| `includeFormattedMessage` | `true` | Should the formatted log message be included.
| `includeExceptionInMessage` | `true` | Should the stacktrace be appended to the formatted log message.
This setting is only evaluated if `includeFormattedMessage` is `true`
| `includeContextName` | `true` | Should the logging context be included
| `includeMessage` | `false` | Should the log message with blank placeholders be included
| `includeException` | `false` | Should the stacktrace be included as a own field
| `serviceContext` | none | Define the Stackdriver service context data (service and version). This allows filtering of error reports for service and version in the https://console.cloud.google.com/errors[Google Cloud Error Reporting View].
| `customJson` | none | Defines custom json data. Data will be added to the json output.
|=======================================================================

This is an example of such an Logback configuration:

[source, xml]
----
<configuration >
  <property name="projectId" value="${projectId:-${GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT}}"/>

  <appender name="CONSOLE_JSON" class="ch.qos.logback.core.ConsoleAppender">
    <encoder class="ch.qos.logback.core.encoder.LayoutWrappingEncoder">
      <layout class="org.springframework.cloud.gcp.logging.StackdriverJsonLayout">
        <projectId>${projectId}</projectId>

        <!--<includeTraceId>true</includeTraceId>-->
        <!--<includeSpanId>true</includeSpanId>-->
        <!--<includeLevel>true</includeLevel>-->
        <!--<includeThreadName>true</includeThreadName>-->
        <!--<includeMDC>true</includeMDC>-->
        <!--<includeLoggerName>true</includeLoggerName>-->
        <!--<includeFormattedMessage>true</includeFormattedMessage>-->
        <!--<includeExceptionInMessage>true</includeExceptionInMessage>-->
        <!--<includeContextName>true</includeContextName>-->
        <!--<includeMessage>false</includeMessage>-->
        <!--<includeException>false</includeException>-->
        <!--<serviceContext>
              <service>service-name</service>
              <version>service-version</version>
            </serviceContext>-->
        <!--<customJson>{"custom-key": "custom-value"}</customJson>-->
      </layout>
    </encoder>
  </appender>
</configuration>
