== Spring Cloud Sleuth

https://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-sleuth/[Spring Cloud Sleuth] is an instrumentation framework for Spring Boot applications.
It captures trace information and can forward traces to services like Zipkin for storage and analysis.

Google Cloud Platform provides its own managed distributed tracing service called https://cloud.google.com/trace/[Stackdriver Trace].
Instead of running and maintaining your own Zipkin instance and storage, you can use Stackdriver Trace to store traces, view trace details, generate latency distributions graphs, and generate performance regression reports.

This Spring Cloud GCP starter can forward Spring Cloud Sleuth traces to Stackdriver Trace without an intermediary Zipkin server.

Maven coordinates, using <<getting-started.adoc#_bill_of_materials, Spring Cloud GCP BOM>>:

<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-cloud-gcp-starter-trace</artifactId>

Gradle coordinates:

You must enable Stackdriver Trace API from the Google Cloud Console in order to capture traces.
Navigate to the https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/api/cloudtrace.googleapis.com/overview[Stackdriver Trace API] for your project and make sure it’s enabled.

[NOTE]
====
If you are already using a Zipkin server capturing trace information from multiple platform/frameworks, you can also use a https://cloud.google.com/trace/docs/zipkin[Stackdriver Zipkin proxy] to forward those traces to Stackdriver Trace without modifying existing applications.

=== Tracing

Spring Cloud Sleuth uses the https://github.com/openzipkin/brave[Brave tracer] to generate traces.
This integration enables Brave to use the https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin-gcp/tree/master/propagation-stackdriver[`StackdriverTracePropagation`] propagation.

A propagation is responsible for extracting trace context from an entity (e.g., an HTTP servlet request) and injecting trace context into an entity.
A canonical example of the propagation usage is a web server that receives an HTTP request, which triggers other HTTP requests from the server before returning an HTTP response to the original caller.
In the case of `StackdriverTracePropagation`, first it looks for trace context in the `x-cloud-trace-context` key (e.g., an HTTP request header).
The value of the `x-cloud-trace-context` key can be formatted in three different ways:

* `x-cloud-trace-context: TRACE_ID`
* `x-cloud-trace-context: TRACE_ID/SPAN_ID`
* `x-cloud-trace-context: TRACE_ID/SPAN_ID;o=TRACE_TRUE`

`TRACE_ID` is a 32-character hexadecimal value that encodes a 128-bit number.

`SPAN_ID` is an unsigned long.
Since Stackdriver Trace doesn't support span joins, a new span ID is always generated, regardless of the one specified in `x-cloud-trace-context`.

`TRACE_TRUE` can either be `0` if the entity should be untraced, or `1` if it should be traced.
This field forces the decision of whether or not to trace the request; if omitted then the decision is deferred to the sampler.

If a `x-cloud-trace-context` key isn't found, `StackdriverTracePropagation` falls back to tracing with the https://github.com/openzipkin/b3-propagation[X-B3 headers].

=== Spring Boot Starter for Stackdriver Trace

Spring Boot Starter for Stackdriver Trace uses Spring Cloud Sleuth and auto-configures a https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin-gcp/blob/master/sender-stackdriver/src/main/java/zipkin2/reporter/stackdriver/StackdriverSender.java[StackdriverSender] that sends the Sleuth’s trace information to Stackdriver Trace.

All configurations are optional:

|===
| Name | Description | Required | Default value
| `spring.cloud.gcp.trace.enabled` | Auto-configure Spring Cloud Sleuth to send traces to Stackdriver Trace. | No | `true`
| `spring.cloud.gcp.trace.project-id` | Overrides the project ID from the <<spring-cloud-gcp-core,Spring Cloud GCP Module>> | No |
| `spring.cloud.gcp.trace.credentials.location` | Overrides the credentials location from the <<spring-cloud-gcp-core,Spring Cloud GCP Module>> | No |
| `spring.cloud.gcp.trace.credentials.encoded-key` | Overrides the credentials encoded key from the <<spring-cloud-gcp-core,Spring Cloud GCP Module>> | No |
| `spring.cloud.gcp.trace.credentials.scopes` | Overrides the credentials scopes from the <<spring-cloud-gcp-core,Spring Cloud GCP Module>> | No |
| `spring.cloud.gcp.trace.num-executor-threads` | Number of threads used by the Trace executor | No | 4
| `spring.cloud.gcp.trace.authority` | HTTP/2 authority the channel claims to be connecting to. | No |
| `spring.cloud.gcp.trace.compression` | Name of the compression to use in Trace calls | No |
| `spring.cloud.gcp.trace.deadline-ms` | Call deadline in milliseconds | No |
| `spring.cloud.gcp.trace.max-inbound-size` | Maximum size for inbound messages | No |
| `spring.cloud.gcp.trace.max-outbound-size` | Maximum size for outbound messages | No |
| `spring.cloud.gcp.trace.wait-for-ready` | https://github.com/grpc/grpc/blob/master/doc/wait-for-ready.md[Waits for the channel to be ready] in case of a transient failure | No | `false`
| `spring.cloud.gcp.trace.messageTimeout` | Timeout in seconds before pending spans will be sent in batches to GCP Stackdriver Trace. (previously `spring.zipkin.messageTimeout`) | No | 1
|===

You can use core Spring Cloud Sleuth properties to control Sleuth’s sampling rate, etc.
Read https://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-sleuth/[Sleuth documentation] for more information on Sleuth configurations.

For example, when you are testing to see the traces are going through, you can set the sampling rate to 100%.

[source]
----
spring.sleuth.sampler.probability=1                     # Send 100% of the request traces to Stackdriver.
spring.sleuth.web.skipPattern=(^cleanup.*|.+favicon.*)  # Ignore some URL paths.
----

Spring Cloud GCP Trace does override some Sleuth configurations:

- Always uses 128-bit Trace IDs.
This is required by Stackdriver Trace.
- Does not use Span joins.
Span joins will share the span ID between the client and server Spans.
Stackdriver requires that every Span ID within a Trace to be unique, so Span joins are not supported.
- Uses `StackdriverHttpClientParser` and `StackdriverHttpServerParser` by default to populate Stackdriver related fields.

=== Overriding the auto-configuration

Spring Cloud Sleuth supports sending traces to multiple tracing systems as of version 2.1.0.
In order to get this to work, every tracing system needs to have a `Reporter<Span>` and `Sender`.
If you want to override the provided beans you need to give them a specific name.
To do this you can use respectively `StackdriverTraceAutoConfiguration.REPORTER_BEAN_NAME` and `StackdriverTraceAutoConfiguration.SENDER_BEAN_NAME`.

=== Customizing spans

You can add additional tags and annotations to spans by using the `brave.SpanCustomizer`, which is available in the application context.

Here's an example that uses `WebMvcConfigurer` to configure an MVC interceptor that adds two extra tags to all web controller spans.

[source,java]
----
@SpringBootApplication
public class Application implements WebMvcConfigurer {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		SpringApplication.run(Application.class, args);
	}

	@Autowired
	private SpanCustomizer spanCustomizer;

	@Override
	public void addInterceptors(InterceptorRegistry registry) {
		registry.addInterceptor(new HandlerInterceptor() {
			@Override
			public boolean preHandle(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response, Object handler) throws Exception {
				spanCustomizer.tag("session-id", request.getSession().getId());
				spanCustomizer.tag("environment", "QA");

				return true;
			}
		});
	}
}
----

You can then search and filter traces based on these additional tags in the Stackdriver Trace service.

=== Integration with Logging

Integration with Stackdriver Logging is available through the link:logging.adoc[Stackdriver Logging Support].
If the Trace integration is used together with the Logging one, the request logs will be associated to the corresponding traces.
The trace logs can be viewed by going to the https://console.cloud.google.com/traces/traces[Google Cloud Console Trace List], selecting a trace and pressing the `Logs -> View` link in the `Details` section.

=== Sample

A https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-gcp/tree/master/spring-cloud-gcp-samples/spring-cloud-gcp-trace-sample[sample application] and a https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/cloud-spring-cloud-gcp-trace/index.html[codelab] are available.
