== Secret Manager

https://cloud.google.com/secret-manager[Google Cloud Secret Manager] is a secure and convenient method for storing API keys, passwords, certificates, and other sensitive data.
A detailed summary of its features can be found in the https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/identity-security/introducing-google-clouds-secret-manager[Secret Manager documentation].

Spring Cloud GCP provides:

* A Spring Boot starter which automatically loads the secrets of your GCP project into your application context as a https://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-commons/multi/multi__spring_cloud_context_application_context_services.html#_the_bootstrap_application_context[Bootstrap Property Source].
* A `SecretManagerTemplate` which allows you to read, write, and update secrets in Secret Manager.

=== Dependency Setup

To begin using this library, add the `spring-cloud-gcp-starter-secretmanager` artifact to your project.

Maven coordinates, using <<getting-started.adoc#_bill_of_materials, Spring Cloud GCP BOM>>:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
  <artifactId>spring-cloud-gcp-starter-secretmanager</artifactId>
</dependency>
----

Gradle coordinates:

[source]
----
dependencies {
  compile group: 'org.springframework.cloud', name: 'spring-cloud-gcp-starter-secretmanager'
}
----

=== Secret Manager Property Source

The Spring Cloud GCP integration for Google Cloud Secret Manager enables you to use Secret Manager as a bootstrap property source.

This feature allows you to automatically load your GCP project's secrets as properties into the application context during the https://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-commons/reference/html/#the-bootstrap-application-context[Bootstrap Phase], which refers to the initial phase when a Spring application is being loaded.

NOTE: This feature disabled by default; to use it, you must set `spring.cloud.gcp.secretmanager.bootstrap.enabled` to **true**.

Spring Cloud GCP will load the **latest** version of each secret into the application context.

All secrets will be loaded into the application environment using their `secretId` as the property name.
For example, if your secret's id is `my-secret` then it will be accessible as a property using the name `my-secret`.
If you would like to append a prefix string to all property names imported from Secret Manager, you may use the `spring.cloud.gcp.secretmanager.secret-name-prefix` setting described below.

Spring Cloud GCP Secret Manager offers several configuration properties to customize the behavior.

|===
| Name | Description | Required | Default value
| `spring.cloud.gcp.secretmanager.bootstrap.enabled` | Enables loading secrets from Secret Manager as a bootstrap property source. Set this to **true** to enable the feature. | No | `false`
| `spring.cloud.gcp.secretmanager.secret-name-prefix` | A prefix string to prepend to the property names of secrets read from Secret Manager | No | "" (empty string)

See the Authentication Settings section below for information on how to set properties to authenticate to Secret Manager.

=== Secret Manager Template

The `SecretManagerTemplate` class simplifies operations of creating, updating, and reading secrets.

To begin using this class, you may inject an instance of the class using `@Autowired` after adding the starter dependency to your project.

[source, java]
----
@Autowired
private SecretManagerTemplate secretManagerTemplate;
----

Please consult https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-gcp/blob/master/spring-cloud-gcp-secretmanager/src/main/java/org/springframework/cloud/gcp/secretmanager/SecretManagerOperations.java[`SecretManagerOperations`] for information on what operations are available for the Secret Manager template.

|===
| Name | Description | Required | Default value
| `spring.cloud.gcp.secretmanager.enabled` | Enables the autowiring of the `SecretManagerTemplate` in the application context. | No | `true`
|===

See the Authentication Settings section below for information on how to set properties to authenticate to Secret Manager.

=== Authentication Settings

By default, Spring Cloud GCP Secret Manager will authenticate using Application Default Credentials.
This can be overridden using the authentication properties below.

|===
| Name | Description | Required | Default value
| `spring.cloud.gcp.secretmanager.credentials.location` | OAuth2 credentials for authenticating to the Google Cloud Secret Manager API. | No | By default, infers credentials from https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/production[Application Default Credentials].
| `spring.cloud.gcp.secretmanager.credentials.encoded-key` | Base64-encoded contents of OAuth2 account private key for authenticating to the Google Cloud Secret Manager API. | No | By default, infers credentials from https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/production[Application Default Credentials].
| `spring.cloud.gcp.secretmanager.project-id` | The GCP Project used to access Secret Manager API. | No | By default, infers the project from https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/production[Application Default Credentials].

=== Sample Application

A https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-gcp/tree/master/spring-cloud-gcp-samples/spring-cloud-gcp-secretmanager-sample[Secret Manager Sample Application] is provided which demonstrates basic property source loading and usage of the template class.
