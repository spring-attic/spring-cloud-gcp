== Introduction

The Spring Cloud GCP project makes the Spring Framework a first-class citizen of Google Cloud Platform (GCP).

Spring Cloud GCP lets you leverage the power and simplicity of the Spring Framework to:

- Publish and subscribe to Google Cloud Pub/Sub topics
- Configure Spring JDBC with a few properties to use Google Cloud SQL
- Map objects, relationships, and collections with Spring Data Cloud Spanner, Spring Data Cloud Datastore and Spring Data Reactive Repositories for Cloud Firestore
- Write and read from Spring Resources backed up by Google Cloud Storage
- Exchange messages with Spring Integration using Google Cloud Pub/Sub on the background
- Trace the execution of your app with Spring Cloud Sleuth and Google Stackdriver Trace
- Configure your app with Spring Cloud Config, backed up by the Google Runtime Configuration API
- Consume and produce Google Cloud Storage data via Spring Integration GCS Channel Adapters
- Use Spring Security via Google Cloud IAP
- Analyze your images for text, objects, and other content with Google Cloud Vision
