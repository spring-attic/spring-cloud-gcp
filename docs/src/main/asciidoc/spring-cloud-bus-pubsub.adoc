== Spring Cloud Bus

Using link:https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/[Cloud Pub/Sub] as the link:https://spring.io/projects/spring-cloud-bus[Spring Cloud Bus] implementation is as simple as importing the `spring-cloud-gcp-starter-bus-pubsub` starter.

This starter brings in the <<spring-stream#_spring_cloud_stream,Spring Cloud Stream binder for Cloud Pub/Sub>>, which is used to both publish and subscribe to the bus.
If the bus topic (named `springCloudBus` by default) does not exist, the binder automatically creates it.
The binder also creates anonymous subscriptions for each project using the `spring-cloud-gcp-starter-bus-pubsub` starter.

=== Configuration Management with Spring Cloud Config and Spring Cloud Bus

Spring Cloud Bus can be used to push configuration changes from a Spring Cloud Config server to the clients listening on the same bus.

To use GCP Pub/Sub as the bus implementation, both the configuration server and the configuration client need the `spring-cloud-gcp-starter-bus-pubsub` dependency.

All other configuration is standard to https://spring.io/projects/spring-cloud-config[Spring Cloud Config].

Spring Cloud Config Server typically runs on port `8888`, and can read configuration from a link:https://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-config/spring-cloud-config.html#_environment_repository[variety of source control systems] such as GitHub, and even from the local filesystem.
When the server is notified that new configuration is available, it fetches the updated configuration and sends a notification (`RefreshRemoteApplicationEvent`) out via Spring Cloud Bus.

When configuration is stored locally, config server polls the parent directory for changes.
With configuration stored in source control repository, such as GitHub, the config server needs to be notified that a new version of configuration is available.
In a deployed server, this would be done automatically through a GitHub webhook, but in a local testing scenario, the `/monitor` HTTP endpoint needs to be invoked manually.

curl -X POST http://localhost:8888/monitor -H "X-Github-Event: push" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"commits": [{"modified": ["application.properties"]}]}'

By adding the `spring-cloud-gcp-starter-bus-pubsub` dependency, you instruct Spring Cloud Bus to use Cloud Pub/Sub to broadcast configuration changes.
Spring Cloud Bus will then create a topic named `springCloudBus`, as well as a subscription for each configuration client.

The configuration server happens to also be a configuration client, subscribing to the configuration changes that it sends out.
Thus, in a scenario with one configuration server and one configuration client, two anonymous subscriptions to the `springCloudBus` topic are created.
However, a config server disables configuration refresh by default (see link:https://static.javadoc.io/org.springframework.cloud/spring-cloud-config-server/2.1.0.RELEASE/index.html[ConfigServerBootstrapApplicationListener] for more details).

A https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-gcp/tree/main/spring-cloud-gcp-samples/spring-cloud-gcp-pubsub-bus-config-sample[demo application] showing configuration management and distribution over a Cloud Pub/Sub-powered bus is available.
The sample contains two examples of configuration management with Spring Cloud Bus: one monitoring a local file system, and the other retrieving configuration from a GitHub repository.
