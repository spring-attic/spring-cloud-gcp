== Cloud Memorystore for Redis

=== Spring Caching

https://cloud.google.com/memorystore/[Cloud Memorystore for Redis] provides a fully managed in-memory data store service.
Cloud Memorystore is compatible with the Redis protocol, allowing easy integration with https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/boot-features-caching.html[Spring Caching].

All you have to do is create a Cloud Memorystore instance and use its IP address in `application.properties` file as `spring.redis.host` property value. Everything else is exactly the same as setting up redis-backed Spring caching.

[NOTE]
====
Memorystore instances and your application instances have to be located in the same region.
====

In short, the following dependencies are needed:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-cache</artifactId>
</dependency>
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-data-redis</artifactId>
</dependency>
----

And then you can use `org.springframework.cache.annotation.Cacheable` annotation for methods you'd like to be cached.
[source,java]
----
@Cacheable("cache1")
public String hello(@PathVariable String name) {
    ....
}
----
