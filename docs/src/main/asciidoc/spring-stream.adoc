== Spring Cloud Stream

Spring Cloud GCP provides a https://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-stream/[Spring Cloud Stream] binder to Google Cloud Pub/Sub.

The provided binder relies on the https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-gcp/tree/master/spring-cloud-gcp-pubsub/src/main/java/org/springframework/cloud/gcp/pubsub/integration[Spring Integration Channel Adapters for Google Cloud Pub/Sub].

=== Overview

This binder binds producers to Google Cloud Pub/Sub topics and consumers to subscriptions.

NOTE: Partitioning is currently not supported by this binder.

=== Configuration

You can configure the Spring Cloud Stream Binder for Google Cloud Pub/Sub to automatically generate the underlying resources, like the Google Cloud Pub/Sub topics and subscriptions for producers and consumers.
For that, you can use the `spring.cloud.stream.gcp.pubsub.bindings.<channelName>.<consumer|producer>.auto-create-resources` property, which is turned ON by default.

Starting with version 1.1, these and other binder properties can be configured globally for all the bindings, e.g. `spring.cloud.stream.gcp.pubsub.default.consumer.auto-create-resources`.

If you are using Pub/Sub auto-configuration from the Spring Cloud GCP Pub/Sub Starter, you should refer to the <<pubsub-configuration,configuration>> section for other Pub/Sub parameters.

NOTE: To use this binder with a https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/emulator[running emulator], configure its host and port via `spring.cloud.gcp.pubsub.emulator-host`.

==== Producer Destination Configuration

If automatic resource creation is turned ON and the topic corresponding to the destination name does not exist, it will be created.

For example, for the following configuration, a topic called `myEvents` would be created.

.application.properties
[source]
----
spring.cloud.stream.bindings.events.destination=myEvents
spring.cloud.stream.gcp.pubsub.bindings.events.producer.auto-create-resources=true
----

==== Consumer Destination Configuration

A `PubSubInboundChannelAdapter` will be configured for your consumer endpoint.
You may adjust the ack mode of the consumer endpoint using the `ack-mode` property.
The ack mode controls how messages will be acknowledged when they are successfully received.
The three possible options are: `AUTO` (default), `AUTO_ACK`, and `MANUAL`.
These options are described in detail in the <<inbound-channel-adapter-using-pubsub-streaming-pull, Pub/Sub channel adapter documentation>>.

.application.properties
[source]
----
# How to set the ACK mode of the consumer endpoint.
spring.cloud.stream.gcp.pubsub.bindings.{CONSUMER_NAME}.consumer.ack-mode=AUTO_ACK
----

If automatic resource creation is turned ON and the subscription and/or the topic do not exist for a consumer, a subscription and potentially a topic will be created.
The topic name will be the same as the destination name, and the subscription name will be the destination name followed by the consumer group name.

Regardless of the `auto-create-resources` setting, if the consumer group is not specified, an anonymous one will be created with the name `anonymous.<destinationName>.<randomUUID>`.
Then when the binder shuts down, all Pub/Sub subscriptions created for anonymous consumer groups will be automatically cleaned up.

For example, for the following configuration, a topic named `myEvents` and a subscription called `myEvents.consumerGroup1` would be created.
If the consumer group is not specified, a subscription called `anonymous.myEvents.a6d83782-c5a3-4861-ac38-e6e2af15a7be` would be created and later cleaned up.

IMPORTANT: If you are manually creating Pub/Sub subscriptions for consumers, make sure that they follow the naming convention of `<destinationName>.<consumerGroup>`.

.application.properties
[source]
----
spring.cloud.stream.bindings.events.destination=myEvents
spring.cloud.stream.gcp.pubsub.bindings.events.consumer.auto-create-resources=true

# specify consumer group, and avoid anonymous consumer group generation
spring.cloud.stream.bindings.events.group=consumerGroup1

=== Binding with Functions

Since version 3.0, Spring Cloud Stream supports a functional programming model natively.
This means that the only requirement for turning your application into a sink is presence of a `java.util.function.Consumer` bean in the application context.

```
@Bean
public Consumer<UserMessage> logUserMessage() {
  return userMessage -> {
    // process message
  }
};
```

A source application is one where a `Supplier` bean is present.
It can return an object, in which case Spring Cloud Stream will invoke the supplier repeatedly.
Alternatively, the function can return a reactive stream, which will be used as is.

```
@Bean
Supplier<Flux<UserMessage>> generateUserMessages() {
  return () -> /* flux creation logic */;
}
```

A processor application works similarly to a source application, except it is triggered by presence of a `Function` bean.


=== Binding with Annotations

NOTE: As of version 3.0, annotation binding is considered legacy.

To set up a sink application in this style, you would associate a class with a binding interface, such as the built-in `Sink` interface.

```
@EnableBinding(Sink.class)
public class SinkExample {

	@StreamListener(Sink.INPUT)
	public void handleMessage(UserMessage userMessage) {
		// process message
	}
}
```

To set up a source application, you would similarly associate a class with a built-in `Source` interface, and inject an instance of it provided by Spring Cloud Stream.

```
@EnableBinding(Source.class)
public class SourceExample {

	@Autowired
	private Source source;

	public void sendMessage() {
		this.source.output().send(new GenericMessage<>(/* your object here */));
	}
}
```


=== Streaming vs. Polled Input

Many Spring Cloud Stream applications will use the built-in `Sink` binding, which triggers the _streaming_ input binder creation.
Messages can then be consumed with an input handler marked by `@StreamListener(Sink.INPUT)` annotation, at whatever rate Pub/Sub sends them.

For more control over the rate of message arrival, a polled input binder can be set up by defining a custom binding interface with an `@Input`-annotated method returning `PollableMessageSource`.

[source,java]
----
public interface PollableSink {

	@Input("input")
	PollableMessageSource input();
}
----

The `PollableMessageSource` can then be injected and queried, as needed.

[source,java]
----
@EnableBinding(PollableSink.class)
public class SinkExample {

    @Autowired
    PollableMessageSource destIn;

    @Bean
    public ApplicationRunner singlePollRunner() {
        return args -> {
            // This will poll only once.
            // Add a loop or a scheduler to get more messages.
            destIn.poll((message) -> System.out.println("Message retrieved: " + message));
        };
    }
}
