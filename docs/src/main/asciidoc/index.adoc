== Introduction

The Spring Cloud GCP project aims at making the Spring Framework a first-class citizen of Google
Cloud Platform (GCP).

Currently, Spring Cloud GCP lets you leverage the power and simplicity of the Spring framework to:

1. Publish and subscribe from Google Cloud Pub/Sub topics
2. Configure Spring JDBC with a few properties to use Google Cloud SQL
3. Write and read from Spring Resources backed up by Google Cloud Storage
4. Exchange messages with Spring Integration using Google Cloud Pub/Sub on the background
5. Trace the execution of your app with Spring Cloud Sleuth and Google Stackdriver Trace
6. Configure your app with Spring Cloud Config, backed up by the Google Runtime Configuration API
7. Consume and produce Google Cloud Storage data via Spring Integration GCS Channel Adapters
