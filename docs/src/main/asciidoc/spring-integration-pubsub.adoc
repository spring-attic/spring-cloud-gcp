=== Channel Adapters for Cloud Pub/Sub

The channel adapters for Google Cloud Pub/Sub connect your Spring https://docs.spring.io/spring-integration/reference/html/channel.html[`MessageChannels`] to Google Cloud Pub/Sub topics and subscriptions.
This enables messaging between different processes, applications or micro-services backed up by Google Cloud Pub/Sub.

The Spring Integration Channel Adapters for Google Cloud Pub/Sub are included in the `spring-cloud-gcp-pubsub` module and can be autoconfigured by using the `spring-cloud-gcp-starter-pubsub` module in combination with a Spring Integration dependency.

==== Inbound channel adapter (using Pub/Sub Streaming Pull)

`PubSubInboundChannelAdapter` is the inbound channel adapter for GCP Pub/Sub that listens to a GCP Pub/Sub subscription for new messages.
It converts new messages to an internal Spring https://docs.spring.io/spring-integration/reference/html/messaging-construction-chapter.html#message[`Message`] and then sends it to the bound output channel.

Google Pub/Sub treats message payloads as byte arrays.
So, by default, the inbound channel adapter will construct the Spring `Message` with `byte[]` as the payload.
However, you can change the desired payload type by setting the `payloadType` property of the `PubSubInboundChannelAdapter`.
The `PubSubInboundChannelAdapter` delegates the conversion to the desired payload type to the `PubSubMessageConverter` configured in the `PubSubTemplate`.


To use the inbound channel adapter, a `PubSubInboundChannelAdapter` must be provided and configured on the user application side.

[source,java]
----
@Bean
public MessageChannel pubsubInputChannel() {
    return new PublishSubscribeChannel();
}

@Bean
public PubSubInboundChannelAdapter messageChannelAdapter(
    @Qualifier("pubsubInputChannel") MessageChannel inputChannel,
    PubSubSubscriberOperations subscriberOperations) {
    PubSubInboundChannelAdapter adapter =
        new PubSubInboundChannelAdapter(subscriberOperations, "subscriptionName");
    adapter.setOutputChannel(inputChannel);
    adapter.setAckMode(AckMode.MANUAL);

    return adapter;
}
----

In the example, we first specify the `MessageChannel` where the adapter is going to write incoming messages to.
The `MessageChannel` implementation isn't important here.
Depending on your use case, you might want to use a `MessageChannel` other than `PublishSubscribeChannel`.

Then, we declare a `PubSubInboundChannelAdapter` bean.
It requires the channel we just created and a `SubscriberFactory`, which creates `Subscriber` objects from the Google Cloud Java Client for Pub/Sub.
The Spring Boot starter for GCP Pub/Sub provides a configured `PubSubSubscriberOperations` object.

===== Acknowledging messages and handling failures
When working with Cloud Pub/Sub, it is important to understand the concept of `ackDeadline` -- the amount of time Cloud Pub/Sub will wait until attempting redelivery of an outstanding message.
Each subscription has a default `ackDeadline` applied to all messages sent to it.
Additionally, the Cloud Pub/Sub client library can extend each streamed message's `ackDeadline` until the message processing completes, fails or until the maximum extension period elapses.

NOTE: In the Pub/Sub client library, default maximum extension period is an hour. However, Spring Cloud GCP disables this auto-extension behavior.
Use the `spring.cloud.gcp.pubsub.subscriber.max-ack-extension-period` property to re-enable it.

Acknowledging (acking) a message removes it from Pub/Sub's known outstanding messages. Nacking a message resets its acknowledgement deadline to 0, forcing immediate redelivery.
This could be useful in a load balanced architecture, where one of the subscribers is having issues but others are available to process messages.

The `PubSubInboundChannelAdapter` supports three acknowledgement modes: the default `AckMode.AUTO` (automatic acking on processing success and nacking on exception), as well as two modes for additional manual control: AckMode.AUTO_ACK (automatic acking on success but no action on exception) and AckMode.MANUAL (no automatic actions at all; both acking and nacking have to be done manually).

.Acknowledgement mode behavior
|===
| |AUTO |AUTO_ACK |MANUAL

| Message processing completes successfully
| ack, no redelivery
| ack, no redelivery
| <no action>*

|Message processing fails, but error handler completes successfully**
| ack, no redelivery
| ack, no redelivery
| <no action>*

|Message processing fails; no error handler present
| nack, immediate redelivery
| <no action>*
| <no action>*

|Message processing fails, and error handler throws an exception
| nack, immediate redelivery
| <no action>*
| <no action>*
|===

{empty}* <no action> means that the message will be neither acked nor nacked.
Cloud Pub/Sub will attempt redelivery according to subscription `ackDeadline` setting and the `max-ack-extension-period` client library setting.

{empty}** For the adapter, "success" means the Spring Integration flow processed without raising an exception, so successful message processing and the successful completion of an error handler both result in the same behavior (message will be acknowledged).
To trigger default error behavior (nacking in `AUTO` mode; neither acking nor nacking in `AUTO_ACK` mode), propagate the error back to the adapter by throwing an exception from the <<Error Handling,Error Handling flow>>.

====== Manual acking/nacking

The adapter attaches a `BasicAcknowledgeablePubsubMessage` object to the `Message` headers.
Users can extract the `BasicAcknowledgeablePubsubMessage` using the `GcpPubSubHeaders.ORIGINAL_MESSAGE` key and use it to ack (or nack) a message.

[source,java]
----
@Bean
@ServiceActivator(inputChannel = "pubsubInputChannel")
public MessageHandler messageReceiver() {
    return message -> {
        LOGGER.info("Message arrived! Payload: " + new String((byte[]) message.getPayload()));
        BasicAcknowledgeablePubsubMessage originalMessage =
              message.getHeaders().get(GcpPubSubHeaders.ORIGINAL_MESSAGE, BasicAcknowledgeablePubsubMessage.class);
        originalMessage.ack();
    };
}
----

====== Error Handling

If you want to have more control over message processing in case of an error, you need to associate the `PubSubInboundChannelAdapter` with a Spring Integration error channel and specify the behavior to be invoked with `@ServiceActivator`.

NOTE: In order to activate the default behavior (nacking in `AUTO` mode; neither acking nor nacking in `AUTO_ACK` mode), your error handler has to throw an exception.
Otherwise, the adapter will assume that processing completed successfully and will ack the message.

[source,java]
----
@Bean
public MessageChannel pubsubInputChannel() {
    return new PublishSubscribeChannel();
}

@Bean
public PubSubInboundChannelAdapter messageChannelAdapter(
    @Qualifier("pubsubInputChannel") MessageChannel inputChannel,
    SubscriberFactory subscriberFactory) {
    PubSubInboundChannelAdapter adapter =
        new PubSubInboundChannelAdapter(subscriberFactory, "subscriptionName");
    adapter.setOutputChannel(inputChannel);
    adapter.setAckMode(AckMode.AUTO_ACK);
    adapter.setErrorChannelName("pubsubErrors");

    return adapter;
}

@ServiceActivator(inputChannel =  "pubsubErrors")
public void pubsubErrorHandler(Message<MessagingException> message) {
	LOGGER.warn("This message will be automatically acked because error handler completes successfully");
}
----

If you would prefer to manually ack or nack the message, you can do it by retrieving the header of the exception payload:

[source,java]
----

@ServiceActivator(inputChannel =  "pubsubErrors")
public void pubsubErrorHandler(Message<MessagingException> exceptionMessage) {

	BasicAcknowledgeablePubsubMessage originalMessage =
	  (BasicAcknowledgeablePubsubMessage)exceptionMessage.getPayload().getFailedMessage()
	    .getHeaders().get(GcpPubSubHeaders.ORIGINAL_MESSAGE);

	originalMessage.nack();
}
----



==== Pollable Message Source (using Pub/Sub Synchronous Pull)

While `PubSubInboundChannelAdapter`, through the underlying Asynchronous Pull Pub/Sub mechanism, provides the best performance for high-volume applications that receive a steady flow of messages, it can create load balancing anomalies due to message caching.
This behavior is most obvious when publishing a large batch of small messages that take a long time to process individually.
It manifests as one subscriber taking up most messages, even if multiple subscribers are available to take on the work.
For a more detailed explanation of this scenario, see https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/pull#streamingpull_dealing_with_large_backlogs_of_small_messages[GCP Pub/Sub documentation].

In such a scenario, a `PubSubMessageSource` can help spread the load between different subscribers more evenly.

As with the Inbound Channel Adapter, the message source has a configurable acknowledgement mode, payload type, and header mapping.

The default behavior is to return from the synchronous pull operation immediately if no messages are present.
This can be overridden by using `setBlockOnPull()` method to wait for at least one message to arrive.

By default, `PubSubMessageSource` pulls from the subscription one message at a time.
To pull a batch of messages on each request, use the `setMaxFetchSize()` method to set the batch size.

[source,java]
----
@Bean
@InboundChannelAdapter(channel = "pubsubInputChannel", poller = @Poller(fixedDelay = "100"))
public MessageSource<Object> pubsubAdapter(PubSubTemplate pubSubTemplate) {
	PubSubMessageSource messageSource = new PubSubMessageSource(pubSubTemplate,  "exampleSubscription");
	messageSource.setAckMode(AckMode.MANUAL);
	messageSource.setPayloadType(String.class);
	messageSource.setBlockOnPull(true);
	messageSource.setMaxFetchSize(100);
	return messageSource;
}
----

The `@InboundChannelAdapter` annotation above ensures that the configured `MessageSource` is polled for messages, which are then available for manipulation with any Spring Integration mechanism on the `pubsubInputChannel` message channel.
For example, messages can be retrieved in a method annotated with `@ServiceActivator`, as seen below.

For additional flexibility, `PubSubMessageSource` attaches an `AcknowledgeablePubSubMessage` object to the `GcpPubSubHeaders.ORIGINAL_MESSAGE` message header.
The object can be used for manually (n)acking the message.

[source,java]
----
@ServiceActivator(inputChannel = "pubsubInputChannel")
public void messageReceiver(String payload,
        @Header(GcpPubSubHeaders.ORIGINAL_MESSAGE) AcknowledgeablePubsubMessage message)
            throws InterruptedException {
    LOGGER.info("Message arrived by Synchronous Pull! Payload: " + payload);
    message.ack();
}
----

NOTE: `AcknowledgeablePubSubMessage` objects acquired by synchronous pull are aware of their own acknowledgement IDs.
Streaming pull does not expose this information due to limitations of the underlying API, and returns `BasicAcknowledgeablePubsubMessage` objects that allow acking/nacking individual messages, but not extracting acknowledgement IDs for future processing.

==== Outbound channel adapter

`PubSubMessageHandler` is the outbound channel adapter for GCP Pub/Sub that listens for new messages on a Spring `MessageChannel`.
It uses `PubSubTemplate` to post them to a GCP Pub/Sub topic.

To construct a Pub/Sub representation of the message, the outbound channel adapter needs to convert the Spring `Message` payload to a byte array representation expected by Pub/Sub.
It delegates this conversion to the `PubSubTemplate`.
To customize the conversion, you can specify a `PubSubMessageConverter` in the `PubSubTemplate` that should convert the `Object` payload and headers of the Spring `Message` to a `PubsubMessage`.

To use the outbound channel adapter, a `PubSubMessageHandler` bean must be provided and configured on the user application side.

[source,java]
----
@Bean
@ServiceActivator(inputChannel = "pubsubOutputChannel")
public MessageHandler messageSender(PubSubTemplate pubsubTemplate) {
    return new PubSubMessageHandler(pubsubTemplate, "topicName");
}
----

The provided `PubSubTemplate` contains all the necessary configuration to publish messages to a GCP Pub/Sub topic.

`PubSubMessageHandler` publishes messages asynchronously by default.
A publish timeout can be configured for synchronous publishing.
If none is provided, the adapter waits indefinitely for a response.

It is possible to set user-defined callbacks for the `publish()` call in `PubSubMessageHandler` through the `setPublishFutureCallback()` method.
These are useful to process the message ID, in case of success, or the error if any was thrown.

To override the default topic you can use the `GcpPubSubHeaders.TOPIC` header.

[source,java]
----

@Autowired
private MessageChannel pubsubOutputChannel;

public void handleMessage(Message<?> msg) throws MessagingException {
    final Message<?> message = MessageBuilder
        .withPayload(msg.getPayload())
        .setHeader(GcpPubSubHeaders.TOPIC, "customTopic").build();
    pubsubOutputChannel.send(message);
}
----

It is also possible to set an SpEL expression for the topic with the `setTopicExpression()` or `setTopicExpressionString()` methods.

==== Header mapping

These channel adapters contain header mappers that allow you to map, or filter out, headers from Spring to Google Cloud Pub/Sub messages, and vice-versa.
By default, the inbound channel adapter maps every header on the Google Cloud Pub/Sub messages to the Spring messages produced by the adapter.
The outbound channel adapter maps every header from Spring messages into Google Cloud Pub/Sub ones, except the ones added by Spring, like headers with key `"id"`, `"timestamp"` and `"gcp_pubsub_acknowledgement"`.
In the process, the outbound mapper also converts the value of the headers into string.

Each adapter declares a `setHeaderMapper()` method to let you further customize which headers you want to map from Spring to Google Cloud Pub/Sub, and vice-versa.

For example, to filter out headers `"foo"`, `"bar"` and all headers starting with the prefix "prefix_", you can use `setHeaderMapper()` along with the `PubSubHeaderMapper` implementation provided by this module.

[source,java]
----
PubSubMessageHandler adapter = ...
...
PubSubHeaderMapper headerMapper = new PubSubHeaderMapper();
headerMapper.setOutboundHeaderPatterns("!foo", "!bar", "!prefix_*", "*");
adapter.setHeaderMapper(headerMapper);
----

NOTE: The order in which the patterns are declared in `PubSubHeaderMapper.setOutboundHeaderPatterns()` and `PubSubHeaderMapper.setInboundHeaderPatterns()` matters.
The first patterns have precedence over the following ones.

In the previous example, the `"*"` pattern means every header is mapped.
However, because it comes last in the list, https://docs.spring.io/spring-integration/api/org/springframework/integration/util/PatternMatchUtils.html#smartMatch-java.lang.String-java.lang.String...-[the previous patterns take precedence].
