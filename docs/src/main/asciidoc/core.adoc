[#spring-cloud-gcp-core]
== Spring Cloud GCP Core

Each Spring Cloud GCP module uses `GcpProjectIdProvider` and `CredentialsProvider` to get the GCP project ID and access credentials.

Spring Cloud GCP provides a Spring Boot starter to auto-configure the core components.

Maven coordinates, using <<getting-started.adoc#_bill_of_materials, Spring Cloud GCP BOM>>:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-cloud-gcp-starter</artifactId>
</dependency>
----

Gradle coordinates:

[source,subs="normal"]
----

    compile group: 'org.springframework.cloud', name: 'spring-cloud-gcp-starter'
}

=== Project ID

`GcpProjectIdProvider` is a functional interface that returns a GCP project ID string.

[source,java]
----
public interface GcpProjectIdProvider {
	String getProjectId();
}
----

The Spring Cloud GCP starter auto-configures a `GcpProjectIdProvider`.
If a `spring.cloud.gcp.project-id` property is specified, the provided `GcpProjectIdProvider` returns that property value.

[source,java]
----
spring.cloud.gcp.project-id=my-gcp-project-id
----

Otherwise, the project ID is discovered based on an
https://googlecloudplatform.github.io/google-cloud-java/google-cloud-clients/apidocs/com/google/cloud/ServiceOptions.html#getDefaultProjectId--[ordered list of rules]:

1. The project ID specified by the `GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT` environment variable
2. The Google App Engine project ID
3. The project ID specified in the JSON credentials file pointed by the `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` environment variable
4. The Google Cloud SDK project ID
5. The Google Compute Engine project ID, from the Google Compute Engine Metadata Server

=== Credentials

`CredentialsProvider` is a functional interface that returns the credentials to authenticate and authorize calls to Google Cloud Client Libraries.

[source,java]
----
public interface CredentialsProvider {
  Credentials getCredentials() throws IOException;
}
----

The Spring Cloud GCP starter auto-configures a `CredentialsProvider`.
It uses the `spring.cloud.gcp.credentials.location` property to locate the OAuth2 private key of a Google service account.
Keep in mind this property is a Spring Resource, so the credentials file can be obtained from a number of https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/html/resources.html#resources-implementations[different locations] such as the file system, classpath, URL, etc.
The next example specifies the credentials location property in the file system.

[source]
----
spring.cloud.gcp.credentials.location=file:/usr/local/key.json
----

Alternatively, you can set the credentials by directly specifying the `spring.cloud.gcp.credentials.encoded-key` property.
The value should be the base64-encoded account private key in JSON format.

If that credentials aren't specified through properties, the starter tries to discover credentials from a https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/google-cloud-java#authentication[number of places]:

1. Credentials file pointed to by the `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` environment variable
2. Credentials provided by the Google Cloud SDK `gcloud auth application-default login` command
3. Google App Engine built-in credentials
4. Google Cloud Shell built-in credentials
5. Google Compute Engine built-in credentials

If your app is running on Google App Engine or Google Compute Engine, in most cases, you should omit the `spring.cloud.gcp.credentials.location` property and, instead, let the Spring Cloud GCP Starter get the correct credentials for those environments.
On App Engine Standard, the https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/java/appidentity/[App Identity service account credentials] are used, on App Engine Flexible, the https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/flexible/java/service-account[Flexible service account credential] are used and on Google Compute Engine, the https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/access/create-enable-service-accounts-for-instances#using_the_compute_engine_default_service_account[Compute Engine Default Service Account] is used.

==== Scopes

By default, the credentials provided by the Spring Cloud GCP Starter contain scopes for every service supported by Spring Cloud GCP.

|===
| Service | Scope
| Spanner | https://www.googleapis.com/auth/spanner.admin, https://www.googleapis.com/auth/spanner.data
| Datastore | https://www.googleapis.com/auth/datastore
| Pub/Sub | https://www.googleapis.com/auth/pubsub
| Storage (Read Only) | https://www.googleapis.com/auth/devstorage.read_only
| Storage (Write/Write) | https://www.googleapis.com/auth/devstorage.read_write
| Runtime Config | https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloudruntimeconfig
| Trace (Append) | https://www.googleapis.com/auth/trace.append
| Cloud Platform | https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform
| Vision | https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-vision
|===

The Spring Cloud GCP starter allows you to configure a custom scope list for the provided credentials.
To do that, specify a comma-delimited list of https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/googlescopes[Google OAuth2 scopes] in the `spring.cloud.gcp.credentials.scopes` property.

`spring.cloud.gcp.credentials.scopes` is a comma-delimited list of https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/googlescopes[Google OAuth2 scopes] for Google Cloud Platform services that the credentials returned by the provided `CredentialsProvider` support.

[source]
----
spring.cloud.gcp.credentials.scopes=https://www.googleapis.com/auth/pubsub,https://www.googleapis.com/auth/sqlservice.admin
----

You can also use `DEFAULT_SCOPES` placeholder as a scope to represent the starters default scopes, and append the additional scopes you need to add.

[source]
----
spring.cloud.gcp.credentials.scopes=DEFAULT_SCOPES,https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-vision
----

=== Environment

`GcpEnvironmentProvider` is a functional interface, auto-configured by the Spring Cloud GCP starter, that returns a `GcpEnvironment` enum.
The provider can help determine programmatically in which GCP environment (App Engine Flexible, App Engine Standard, Kubernetes Engine or Compute Engine) the application is deployed.

[source,java]
----
public interface GcpEnvironmentProvider {
	GcpEnvironment getCurrentEnvironment();
}
----

=== Spring Initializr

This starter is available from https://start.spring.io/[Spring Initializr] through the `GCP Support` entry.
