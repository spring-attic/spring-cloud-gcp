== Spring Initializr

Spring Initializr contains Spring Cloud GCP auto-configuration support through the `GCP Support` entry.

`GCP Messaging` contains the Spring Cloud GCP messaging support with Google Cloud Pub/Sub working out of the box.

Similarly to `GCP Messaging`, `GCP Storage` contains the Google Cloud Storage support with no other dependencies needed.

== Spring Cloud GCP Bill of Materials (BOM)

If you're a Maven Central user, add our BOM to your pom.xml `<dependencyManagement>` section.
This will allow you to omit versions for any of the Maven dependencies and instead delegate versioning to the BOM.

[source,xml]
----
<dependencyManagement>
    <dependencies>
        <dependency>
            <groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
            <artifactId>spring-cloud-gcp-dependencies</artifactId>
            <version>1.2.0.RELEASE</version>
            <type>pom</type>
            <scope>import</scope>
        </dependency>
    </dependencies>
</dependencyManagement>
----

== Spring Milestones Maven Repository

The latest non-GA Maven artifacts for the project are available in the Spring Milestones repository instead of Maven Central.
They are named like `1.2.0.M1` or `1.2.0.M2` and are released more frequently than GA `RELEASE` versions.
You will want to make sure that the repository is added to your `pom.xml` file or globally in your https://maven.apache.org/settings.html[`settings.xml`] file.

[source,xml]
----
<repositories>
    <repository>
        <id>spring-milestones</id>
        <name>Spring Milestones</name>
        <url>https://repo.spring.io/milestone</url>
    </repository>
</repositories>

== Spring Snapshots Maven Repository

We offer `BUILD-SNAPSHOT` versions that always reflect the latest code changes to the underlying GitHub repository for Spring Cloud GCP via the Spring Snapshots Repository:

[source,xml]
----
<repositories>
    <repository>
        <id>spring-snapshots</id>
        <name>Spring SnapShots</name>
        <url>https://repo.spring.io/libs-snapshot</url>
        <snapshots>
            <enabled>true</enabled>
        </snapshots>
    </repository>
</repositories>
----

For example, the `1.3.0.BUILD-SNAPSHOT` is available from this repository.

== Spring Boot Starters

Spring Boot greatly simplifies the Spring Cloud GCP experience.
Our starters handle the object instantiation and configuration logic so you don't have to.

Every starter depends on the GCP starter to provide critical bits of configuration, like the GCP project ID or OAuth2 credentials location.
You can configure these as properties in, for example, a properties file:

[source]
----
spring.cloud.gcp.project-id=[YOUR_GCP_PROJECT_ID]
spring.cloud.gcp.credentials.location=file:[LOCAL_PRIVATE_KEY_FILE]
spring.cloud.gcp.credentials.scopes=[SCOPE_1],[SCOPE_2],[SCOPE_3]
----

These properties are optional and, if not specified, Spring Boot will attempt to automatically find them for you.
For details on how Spring Boot finds these properties, refer to the https://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-gcp[documentation].

NOTE: If your app is running on Google App Engine or Google Compute Engine, in most cases, you should omit the `spring.cloud.gcp.credentials.location` property and, instead, let the Spring Cloud GCP Core Starter find the correct credentials for those environments.
