== Google Cloud Pub/Sub

Spring Cloud GCP provides an abstraction layer to publish to and subscribe from Google Cloud Pub/Sub topics and to create, list or delete Google Cloud Pub/Sub topics and subscriptions.

A Spring Boot starter is provided to auto-configure the various required Pub/Sub components.

=== Sample

Sample applications for https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-gcp/tree/master/spring-cloud-gcp-samples/spring-cloud-gcp-pubsub-sample[using the template] and https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-gcp/tree/master/spring-cloud-gcp-samples/spring-cloud-gcp-pubsub-reactive-sample[using a subscription-backed reactive stream] are available.

=== Pub/Sub Operations & Template

`PubSubOperations` is an abstraction that allows Spring users to use Google Cloud Pub/Sub without depending on any Google Cloud Pub/Sub API semantics.
It provides the common set of operations needed to interact with Google Cloud Pub/Sub.
`PubSubTemplate` is the default implementation of `PubSubOperations` and it uses the https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/google-cloud-java/tree/master/google-cloud-pubsub[Google Cloud Java Client for Pub/Sub] to interact with Google Cloud Pub/Sub.

==== Publishing to a topic

`PubSubTemplate` provides asynchronous methods to publish messages to a Google Cloud Pub/Sub topic.
The `publish()` method takes in a topic name to post the message to, a payload of a generic type and, optionally, a map with the message headers.

Here is an example of how to publish a message to a Google Cloud Pub/Sub topic:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::../../test/java/org/springframework/cloud/gcp/autoconfigure/pubsub/it/PubSubTemplateDocumentationTests.java[tag=publish]
----

By default, the `SimplePubSubMessageConverter` is used to convert payloads of type `byte[]`, `ByteString`, `ByteBuffer`, and `String` to Pub/Sub messages.

==== Subscribing to a subscription

Google Cloud Pub/Sub allows many subscriptions to be associated to the same topic.
`PubSubTemplate` allows you to listen to subscriptions via the `subscribe()` method.
When listening to a subscription, messages will be pulled from Google Cloud Pub/Sub
asynchronously and passed to a user provided message handler.

===== Example
Subscribe to a subscription with a message handler:
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::../../test/java/org/springframework/cloud/gcp/autoconfigure/pubsub/it/PubSubTemplateDocumentationTests.java[tag=subscribe]
----
===== Subscribe methods
`PubSubTemplate` provides the following subscribe methods:

[cols="20,80"]
|===
h|subscribe(String subscription, Consumer<BasicAcknowledgeablePubsubMessage> messageConsumer) | asynchronously pulls messages and passes them to `messageConsumer`
h|subscribeAndConvert(String subscription,
 			Consumer<ConvertedBasicAcknowledgeablePubsubMessage<T>> messageConsumer,
 			Class<T> payloadType) | same as `pull`, but converts message payload to `payloadType` using the converter configured in the template
|===


==== Pulling messages from a subscription

Google Cloud Pub/Sub supports synchronous pulling of messages from a subscription.
This is different from subscribing to a subscription, in the sense that subscribing is an asynchronous task.

===== Example
Pull up to 10 messages:
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::../../test/java/org/springframework/cloud/gcp/autoconfigure/pubsub/it/PubSubTemplateDocumentationTests.java[tag=pull]
----

===== Pull methods

`PubsubTemplate` provides the following pull methods:
[cols="20,80"]
|===
h|pull(String subscription, Integer maxMessages,
       			Boolean returnImmediately) | Pulls a number of messages from a subscription, allowing for the retry settings to be configured.
       			Any messages received by `pull()` are not automatically acknowledged. See <<Acknowledging messages>>.

       			If `returnImmediately` is `true`, the system will respond immediately even if it there are no messages available to return in the `Pull` response. Otherwise, the system may wait (for a bounded amount of time) until at least one message is available, rather than returning no messages.
h|pullAndAck | Works the same as the `pull` method and, additionally, acknowledges all received messages.

h|pullNext | Allows for a single message to be pulled and automatically acknowledged from a subscription.

h|pullAndConvert | Works the same as the `pull` method and, additionally, converts the Pub/Sub binary payload to an object of the desired type, using the converter configured in the template.
|===

===== Acknowledging messages

There are two ways to acknowledge messages.

. To acknowledge multiple messages at once, you can use the `PubSubTemplate.ack()` method.
You can also use the `PubSubTemplate.nack()` for negatively acknowledging messages.
Using these methods for acknowledging messages in batches is more efficient than acknowledging messages individually, but they *require* the collection of messages to be from the same project.

. To acknowledge messages individually you can use the `ack()` or `nack()` method on each of them (to acknowledge or negatively acknowledge, correspondingly).

NOTE: All `ack()`, `nack()`, and `modifyAckDeadline()` methods on messages as well as `PubSubSubscriberTemplate` are implemented asynchronously, returning a `ListenableFuture<Void>` to be able to process the asynchronous execution.

==== JSON support

For serialization and deserialization of POJOs using Jackson JSON, configure a `PubSubMessageConverter` bean, and the Spring Boot starter for GCP Pub/Sub will automatically wire it into the `PubSubTemplate`.

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::../../test/java/org/springframework/cloud/gcp/autoconfigure/pubsub/it/PubSubTemplateDocumentationTests.java[tag=json_bean]
----

NOTE: Alternatively, you can set it directly by calling the `setMessageConverter()` method on the `PubSubTemplate`.
Other implementations of the `PubSubMessageConverter` can also be configured in the same manner.

Assuming you have the following class defined:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::../../test/java/org/springframework/cloud/gcp/autoconfigure/pubsub/it/PubSubTemplateDocumentationTests.java[tag=json_convertible_class]
----

You can serialize objects to JSON on publish automatically:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::../../test/java/org/springframework/cloud/gcp/autoconfigure/pubsub/it/PubSubTemplateDocumentationTests.java[tag=json_publish]
----

And thatt's how you convert messages to objects on pull:
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::../../test/java/org/springframework/cloud/gcp/autoconfigure/pubsub/it/PubSubTemplateDocumentationTests.java[tag=json_pull]
----


Please refer to our https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-gcp/tree/master/spring-cloud-gcp-samples/spring-cloud-gcp-integration-pubsub-json-sample[Pub/Sub JSON Payload Sample App] as a reference for using this functionality.

=== Reactive Stream Subscription

It is also possible to acquire a reactive stream backed by a subscription.
To do so, a Project Reactor dependency (`io.projectreactor:reactor-core`) must be added to the project.
The combination of the Pub/Sub starter and the Project Reactor dependencies will then make a `PubSubReactiveFactory` bean available, which can then be used to get a `Publisher`.

[source,java]
----
@Autowired
PubSubReactiveFactory reactiveFactory;

// ...

Flux<AcknowledgeablePubsubMessage> flux
				= reactiveFactory.createPolledFlux("exampleSubscription", 1000);
----

The `Flux` then represents an infinite stream of GCP Pub/Sub messages coming in through the specified subscription.
For unlimited demand, the Pub/Sub subscription will be polled regularly, at intervals determined by `pollingPeriodMs` parameter passed in when creating the `Flux`.
For bounded demand, the `pollingPeriodMs` parameter is unused.
Instead, as many messages as possible (up to the requested number) are delivered immediately, with the remaining messages delivered as they become available.

The full range of Project Reactor operations can be applied to the stream.
For example, if you only want to fetch 5 messages, you can use `limitRequest` operation to turn the infinite stream into a finite one:

[source,java]
----
Flux<AcknowledgeablePubsubMessage> fiveMessageFlux = flux.limitRequest(5);
----

Acknowledging messages flowing through the `Flux` should be manually acknowledged.

[source,java]
----
flux.doOnNext(AcknowledgeablePubsubMessage::ack);
----

=== Pub/Sub management

`PubSubAdmin` is the abstraction provided by Spring Cloud GCP to manage Google Cloud Pub/Sub resources.
It allows for the creation, deletion and listing of topics and subscriptions.

`PubSubAdmin` depends on `GcpProjectIdProvider` and either a `CredentialsProvider` or a `TopicAdminClient` and a `SubscriptionAdminClient`.
If given a `CredentialsProvider`, it creates a `TopicAdminClient` and a `SubscriptionAdminClient` with the Google Cloud Java Library for Pub/Sub default settings.
The Spring Boot starter for GCP Pub/Sub auto-configures a `PubSubAdmin` object using the `GcpProjectIdProvider` and the `CredentialsProvider` auto-configured by the Spring Boot GCP Core starter.

==== Creating a topic

`PubSubAdmin` implements a method to create topics:

[source,java]
----
public Topic createTopic(String topicName)
----

Here is an example of how to create a Google Cloud Pub/Sub topic:

[source,java]
----
public void newTopic() {
    pubSubAdmin.createTopic("topicName");
}
----

==== Deleting a topic

`PubSubAdmin` implements a method to delete topics:

[source,java]
----
public void deleteTopic(String topicName)
----

Here is an example of how to delete a Google Cloud Pub/Sub topic:

[source,java]
----
public void deleteTopic() {
    pubSubAdmin.deleteTopic("topicName");
}
----

==== Listing topics

`PubSubAdmin` implements a method to list topics:

[source,java]
----
public List<Topic> listTopics
----

Here is an example of how to list every Google Cloud Pub/Sub topic name in a project:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::../../test/java/org/springframework/cloud/gcp/autoconfigure/pubsub/it/PubSubTemplateDocumentationTests.java[tag=list_topics]
----

==== Creating a subscription

`PubSubAdmin` implements a method to create subscriptions to existing topics:

[source,java]
----
public Subscription createSubscription(String subscriptionName, String topicName, Integer ackDeadline, String pushEndpoint)
----

Here is an example of how to create a Google Cloud Pub/Sub subscription:

[source,java]
----
public void newSubscription() {
    pubSubAdmin.createSubscription("subscriptionName", "topicName", 10, “https://my.endpoint/push”);
}
----

Alternative methods with default settings are provided for ease of use.
The default value for `ackDeadline` is 10 seconds.
If `pushEndpoint` isn’t specified, the subscription uses message pulling, instead.

[source,java]
----
public Subscription createSubscription(String subscriptionName, String topicName)
----

[source,java]
----
public Subscription createSubscription(String subscriptionName, String topicName, Integer ackDeadline)
----

[source,java]
----
public Subscription createSubscription(String subscriptionName, String topicName, String pushEndpoint)
----

==== Deleting a subscription

`PubSubAdmin` implements a method to delete subscriptions:

[source,java]
----
public void deleteSubscription(String subscriptionName)
----

Here is an example of how to delete a Google Cloud Pub/Sub subscription:

[source,java]
----
public void deleteSubscription() {
    pubSubAdmin.deleteSubscription("subscriptionName");
}
----

==== Listing subscriptions

`PubSubAdmin` implements a method to list subscriptions:

[source,java]
----
public List<Subscription> listSubscriptions()
----

Here is an example of how to list every subscription name in a project:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::../../test/java/org/springframework/cloud/gcp/autoconfigure/pubsub/it/PubSubTemplateDocumentationTests.java[tag=list_subscriptions]
----
