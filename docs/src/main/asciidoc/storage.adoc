== Google Cloud Storage

https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs[Google Cloud Storage] allows storing any types of files in single or multiple regions.
A Spring Boot starter is provided to auto-configure the various Storage components.

Maven coordinates, using <<getting-started.adoc#_bill_of_materials, Spring Cloud GCP BOM>>:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-cloud-gcp-starter-storage</artifactId>
</dependency>
----

Gradle coordinates:

[source,subs="normal"]
----
dependencies {
    compile group: 'org.springframework.cloud', name: 'spring-cloud-gcp-starter-storage'
}
----

This starter is also available from https://start.spring.io/[Spring Initializr] through the `GCP Storage` entry.

=== Using Cloud Storage

The starter automatically configures and registers a `Storage` bean in the Spring application context.
The `Storage` bean (https://googleapis.dev/java/google-cloud-storage/latest/com/google/cloud/storage/Storage.html[Javadoc]) can be used to list/create/update/delete buckets (a group of objects with similar permissions and resiliency requirements) and objects.

[source,java]
----
@Autowired
private Storage storage;

public void createFile() {
    Bucket bucket = storage.create(BucketInfo.of("my-app-storage-bucket"));

    storage.create(
        BlobInfo.newBuilder("my-app-storage-bucket", "subdirectory/my-file").build(),
            "file contents".getBytes()
    );
}
----

=== Cloud Storage Objects As Spring Resources

https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/html/resources.html[Spring Resources] are an abstraction for a number of low-level resources, such as file system files, classpath files, servlet context-relative files, etc.
Spring Cloud GCP adds a new resource type: a Google Cloud Storage (GCS) object.

The Spring Resource Abstraction for Google Cloud Storage allows GCS objects to be accessed by their GCS URL using the `@Value` annotation:

[source,java]
----
@Value("gs://[YOUR_GCS_BUCKET]/[GCS_FILE_NAME]")
private Resource gcsResource;
----

...or the Spring application context

[source,java]
----
SpringApplication.run(...).getResource("gs://[YOUR_GCS_BUCKET]/[GCS_FILE_NAME]");
----


This creates a `Resource` object that can be used to read the object, among https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/html/resources.html#resources-resource[other possible operations].

It is also possible to write to a `Resource`, although a `WriteableResource` is required.

[source,java]
----
@Value("gs://[YOUR_GCS_BUCKET]/[GCS_FILE_NAME]")
private Resource gcsResource;
...
try (OutputStream os = ((WritableResource) gcsResource).getOutputStream()) {
  os.write("foo".getBytes());
}
----

To work with the `Resource` as a Google Cloud Storage resource, cast it to `GoogleStorageResource`.

If the resource path refers to an object on Google Cloud Storage (as opposed to a bucket), then the `getBlob` method can be called to obtain a https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/google-cloud-java/blob/master/google-cloud-storage/src/main/java/com/google/cloud/storage/Blob.java[`Blob`].
This type represents a GCS file, which has associated https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/gsutil/addlhelp/WorkingWithObjectMetadata[metadata], such as content-type, that can be set.
The `createSignedUrl` method can also be used to obtain https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/access-control/signed-urls[signed URLs] for GCS objects.
However, creating signed URLs requires that the resource was created using service account credentials.

The Spring Boot Starter for Google Cloud Storage auto-configures the `Storage` bean required by the `spring-cloud-gcp-storage` module, based on the `CredentialsProvider` provided by the Spring Boot GCP starter.

==== Setting the Content Type

You can set the content-type of Google Cloud Storage files from their corresponding `Resource` objects:

[source,java]
----
((GoogleStorageResource)gcsResource).getBlob().toBuilder().setContentType("text/html").build().update();
----


=== Configuration

The Spring Boot Starter for Google Cloud Storage provides the following configuration options:

|===
| Name | Description | Required | Default value
| `spring.cloud.gcp.storage.enabled` | Enables the GCP storage APIs. | No | `true`
| `spring.cloud.gcp.storage.auto-create-files` | Creates files and buckets on Google Cloud Storage when writes are made to non-existent files | No | `true`
| `spring.cloud.gcp.storage.credentials.location` | OAuth2 credentials for authenticating with the Google Cloud Storage API, if different from the ones in the <<spring-cloud-gcp-core,Spring Cloud GCP Core Module>> | No |
| `spring.cloud.gcp.storage.credentials.encoded-key` |
Base64-encoded contents of OAuth2 account private key for authenticating with the Google Cloud Storage API, if different from the ones in the <<spring-cloud-gcp-core,Spring Cloud GCP Core Module>> | No |
| `spring.cloud.gcp.storage.credentials.scopes` |
https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/googlescopes[OAuth2 scope] for Spring Cloud GCP Storage credentials | No | https://www.googleapis.com/auth/devstorage.read_write
|===
