== Spring Data Cloud Datastore

NOTE: This integration is fully compatible with https://cloud.google.com/datastore/docs/[Firestore in Datastore Mode], but not with Firestore in Native Mode.

https://projects.spring.io/spring-data/[Spring Data] is an abstraction for storing and retrieving POJOs in numerous storage technologies.
Spring Cloud GCP adds Spring Data support for https://cloud.google.com/firestore/[Google Cloud Firestore] in Datastore mode.

This setup takes care of bringing in the latest compatible version of Cloud Java Cloud Datastore libraries as well.

=== Configuration

To setup Spring Data Cloud Datastore, you have to configure the following:

* Setup the connection details to Google Cloud Datastore.

==== Cloud Datastore settings

You can the use link:../spring-cloud-gcp-starters/spring-cloud-gcp-starter-data-datastore[Spring Boot Starter for Spring Data Datastore] to autoconfigure Google Cloud Datastore in your Spring application.
It contains all the necessary setup that makes it easy to authenticate with your Google Cloud project.
The following configuration options are available:

|===
| Name | Description | Required | Default value
| `spring.cloud.gcp.datastore.enabled` | Enables the Cloud Datastore client | No | `true`
| `spring.cloud.gcp.datastore.project-id` | GCP project ID where the Google Cloud Datastore API is hosted, if different from the one in the <<spring-cloud-gcp-core,Spring Cloud GCP Core Module>> | No |
| `spring.cloud.gcp.datastore.credentials.location` | OAuth2 credentials for authenticating with the Google Cloud Datastore API, if different from the ones in the <<spring-cloud-gcp-core,Spring Cloud GCP Core Module>> | No |
| `spring.cloud.gcp.datastore.credentials.encoded-key` | Base64-encoded OAuth2 credentials for authenticating with the Google Cloud Datastore API, if different from the ones in the <<spring-cloud-gcp-core,Spring Cloud GCP Core Module>> | No |
| `spring.cloud.gcp.datastore.credentials.scopes` | https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/googlescopes[OAuth2 scope] for Spring Cloud GCP Cloud Datastore credentials | No | https://www.googleapis.com/auth/datastore
| `spring.cloud.gcp.datastore.namespace` | The Cloud Datastore namespace to use | No | the Default namespace of Cloud Datastore in your GCP project
| `spring.cloud.gcp.datastore.emulator-host` | The `hostname:port` of the https://cloud.google.com/datastore/docs/tools/datastore-emulator[Datastore Emulator] to connect to | No |
|===

==== Repository settings

Spring Data Repositories can be configured via the `@EnableDatastoreRepositories` annotation on your main `@Configuration` class.
With our Spring Boot Starter for Spring Data Cloud Datastore, `@EnableDatastoreRepositories` is automatically added.
It is not required to add it to any other class, unless there is a need to override finer grain configuration parameters provided by https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-gcp/blob/master/spring-cloud-gcp-data-datastore/src/main/java/org/springframework/cloud/gcp/data/datastore/repository/config/EnableDatastoreRepositories.java[`@EnableDatastoreRepositories`].

==== Autoconfiguration

Our Spring Boot autoconfiguration creates the following beans available in the Spring application context:

- an instance of `DatastoreTemplate`
- an instance of all user defined repositories extending `CrudRepository`, `PagingAndSortingRepository`, and `DatastoreRepository` (an extension of `PagingAndSortingRepository` with additional Cloud Datastore features) when repositories are enabled
- an instance of `Datastore` from the Google Cloud Java Client for Datastore, for convenience and lower level API access


=== Object Mapping

Spring Data Cloud Datastore allows you to map domain POJOs to Cloud Datastore kinds and entities via annotations:

[source,java]
----
@Entity(name = "traders")
public class Trader {

	@Id
	@Field(name = "trader_id")
	String traderId;

	String firstName;

	String lastName;

	@Transient
	Double temporaryNumber;
}
----

Spring Data Cloud Datastore will ignore any property annotated with `@Transient`.
These properties will not be written to or read from Cloud Datastore.

==== Constructors

Simple constructors are supported on POJOs.
The constructor arguments can be a subset of the persistent properties.
Every constructor argument needs to have the same name and type as a persistent property on the entity and the constructor should set the property from the given argument.
Arguments that are not directly set to properties are not supported.

[source,java]
----
@Entity(name = "traders")
public class Trader {

	@Id
	@Field(name = "trader_id")
	String traderId;

	String firstName;

	String lastName;

	@Transient
	Double temporaryNumber;

	public Trader(String traderId, String firstName) {
	    this.traderId = traderId;
	    this.firstName = firstName;
	}
}
----


==== Kind

The `@Entity` annotation can provide the name of the Cloud Datastore kind that stores instances of the annotated class, one per row.

==== Keys

`@Id` identifies the property corresponding to the ID value.

You must annotate one of your POJO's fields as the ID value, because every entity in Cloud Datastore requires a single ID value:

[source,java]
----
@Entity(name = "trades")
public class Trade {
	@Id
	@Field(name = "trade_id")
	String tradeId;

	@Field(name = "trader_id")
	String traderId;

	String action;

	Double price;

	Double shares;

	String symbol;
}
----


Datastore can automatically allocate integer ID values.
If a POJO instance with a `Long` ID property is written to Cloud Datastore with `null` as the ID value, then Spring Data Cloud Datastore will obtain a newly allocated ID value from Cloud Datastore and set that in the POJO for saving.
Because primitive `long` ID properties cannot be `null` and default to `0`, keys will not be allocated.

==== Fields

All accessible properties on POJOs are automatically recognized as a Cloud Datastore field.
Field naming is generated by the `PropertyNameFieldNamingStrategy` by default defined on the `DatastoreMappingContext` bean.
The `@Field` annotation optionally provides a different field name than that of the property.


==== Supported Types

Spring Data Cloud Datastore supports the following types for regular fields and elements of collections:

[options="header"]
|===
| Type| Stored as
| `com.google.cloud.Timestamp`|com.google.cloud.datastore.TimestampValue
| `com.google.cloud.datastore.Blob`|com.google.cloud.datastore.BlobValue
| `com.google.cloud.datastore.LatLng`|com.google.cloud.datastore.LatLngValue
| `java.lang.Boolean`, `boolean`|com.google.cloud.datastore.BooleanValue
| `java.lang.Double`, `double`|com.google.cloud.datastore.DoubleValue
| `java.lang.Long`, `long`|com.google.cloud.datastore.LongValue
| `java.lang.Integer`, `int`|com.google.cloud.datastore.LongValue
| `java.lang.String`|com.google.cloud.datastore.StringValue
| `com.google.cloud.datastore.Entity`|com.google.cloud.datastore.EntityValue
| `com.google.cloud.datastore.Key`|com.google.cloud.datastore.KeyValue
| `byte[]`|com.google.cloud.datastore.BlobValue
| Java `enum` values|com.google.cloud.datastore.StringValue
|===

In addition, all types that can be converted to the ones listed in the table by
`org.springframework.core.convert.support.DefaultConversionService` are supported.

==== Custom types

Custom converters can be used extending the type support for user defined types.

. Converters need to implement the `org.springframework.core.convert.converter.Converter` interface in both directions.

. The user defined type needs to be mapped to one of the basic types supported by Cloud Datastore.

. An instance of both Converters (read and write) needs to be passed to the `DatastoreCustomConversions` constructor, which then has to be made available as a `@Bean` for `DatastoreCustomConversions`.

For example:

We would like to have a field of type  `Album` on our `Singer` POJO and want it to be stored as a string property:
[source, java]
----
@Entity
public class Singer {

	@Id
	String singerId;

	String name;

	Album album;
}
----

Where Album is a simple class:

[source, java]
----
public class Album {
	String albumName;

	LocalDate date;
}
----

We have to define the two converters:

[source, java]
----
	//Converter to write custom Album type
	static final Converter<Album, String> ALBUM_STRING_CONVERTER =
			new Converter<Album, String>() {
				@Override
				public String convert(Album album) {
					return album.getAlbumName() + " " + album.getDate().format(DateTimeFormatter.ISO_DATE);
				}
			};

	//Converters to read custom Album type
	static final Converter<String, Album> STRING_ALBUM_CONVERTER =
			new Converter<String, Album>() {
				@Override
				public Album convert(String s) {
					String[] parts = s.split(" ");
					return new Album(parts[0], LocalDate.parse(parts[parts.length - 1], DateTimeFormatter.ISO_DATE));
				}
			};
----

That will be configured in our `@Configuration` file:

[source, java]
----
@Configuration
public class ConverterConfiguration {
	@Bean
	public DatastoreCustomConversions datastoreCustomConversions() {
		return new DatastoreCustomConversions(
				Arrays.asList(
						ALBUM_STRING_CONVERTER,
						STRING_ALBUM_CONVERTER));
	}
}
----

==== Collections and arrays

Arrays and collections (types that implement `java.util.Collection`) of supported types are supported.
They are stored as `com.google.cloud.datastore.ListValue`.
Elements are converted to Cloud Datastore supported types individually. `byte[]` is an exception, it is converted to
`com.google.cloud.datastore.Blob`.


==== Custom Converter for collections
Users can provide converters from  `List<?>` to the custom collection type.
Only read converter is necessary, the Collection API is used on the write side to convert a collection to the internal list type.

Collection converters need to implement the `org.springframework.core.convert.converter.Converter` interface.


Example:

Let's improve the Singer class from the previous example.
Instead of a field of type `Album`, we would like to have a field of type `Set<Album>`:

[source, java]
----
@Entity
public class Singer {

	@Id
	String singerId;

	String name;

	Set<Album> albums;
}
----

We have to define a read converter only:
[source, java]
----
static final Converter<List<?>, Set<?>> LIST_SET_CONVERTER =
			new Converter<List<?>, Set<?>>() {
				@Override
				public Set<?> convert(List<?> source) {
					return Collections.unmodifiableSet(new HashSet<>(source));
				}
			};
----

And add it to the list of custom converters:
[source, java]
----
@Configuration
public class ConverterConfiguration {
	@Bean
	public DatastoreCustomConversions datastoreCustomConversions() {
		return new DatastoreCustomConversions(
				Arrays.asList(
						LIST_SET_CONVERTER,
						ALBUM_STRING_CONVERTER,
						STRING_ALBUM_CONVERTER));
	}
}
----


==== Inheritance Hierarchies

Java entity types related by inheritance can be stored in the same Kind.
When reading and querying entities using `DatastoreRepository` or `DatastoreTemplate` with a superclass as the type parameter, you can receive instances of subclasses if you annotate the superclass and its subclasses with `DiscriminatorField` and `DiscriminatorValue`:

[source, java]
----
@Entity(name = "pets")
@DiscriminatorField(field = "pet_type")
abstract class Pet {
	@Id
	Long id;

	abstract String speak();
}

@DiscriminatorValue("cat")
class Cat extends Pet {
	@Override
	String speak() {
		return "meow";
	}
}

@DiscriminatorValue("dog")
class Dog extends Pet {
	@Override
	String speak() {
		return "woof";
	}
}

@DiscriminatorValue("pug")
class Pug extends Dog {
	@Override
	String speak() {
		return "woof woof";
	}
}
----

Instances of all 3 types are stored in the `pets` Kind.
Because a single Kind is used, all classes in the hierarchy must share the same ID property and no two instances of any type in the hierarchy can share the same ID value.

Entity rows in Cloud Datastore store their respective types' `DiscriminatorValue` in a field specified by the root superclass's `DiscriminatorField` (`pet_type` in this case).
Reads and queries using a given type parameter will match each entity with its specific type.
For example, reading a `List<Pet>` will produce a list containing instances of all 3 types.
However, reading a `List<Dog>` will produce a list containing only `Dog` and `Pug` instances.
You can include the `pet_type` discrimination field in your Java entities, but its type must be convertible to a collection or array of `String`.
Any value set in the discrimination field will be overwritten upon write to Cloud Datastore.


=== Relationships

There are three ways to represent relationships between entities that are described in this section:

* Embedded entities stored directly in the field of the containing entity
* `@Descendant` annotated properties for one-to-many relationships
* `@Reference` annotated properties for general relationships without hierarchy

==== Embedded Entities

Fields whose types are also annotated with `@Entity` are converted to `EntityValue` and stored inside the parent entity.

Here is an example of Cloud Datastore entity containing an embedded entity in JSON:

[source, json]
----
{
  "name" : "Alexander",
  "age" : 47,
  "child" : {"name" : "Philip"  }
}

----

This corresponds to a simple pair of Java entities:

[source, java]
----
import org.springframework.cloud.gcp.data.datastore.core.mapping.Entity;
import org.springframework.data.annotation.Id;

@Entity("parents")
public class Parent {
  @Id
  String name;

  Child child;
}

@Entity
public class Child {
  String name;
}
----

`Child` entities are not stored in their own kind.
They are stored in their entirety in the `child` field of the `parents` kind.

Multiple levels of embedded entities are supported.

NOTE: Embedded entities don't need to have `@Id` field, it is only required for top level entities.

Example:

Entities can hold embedded entities that are their own type.
We can store trees in Cloud Datastore using this feature:

[source, java]
----
import org.springframework.cloud.gcp.data.datastore.core.mapping.Embedded;
import org.springframework.cloud.gcp.data.datastore.core.mapping.Entity;
import org.springframework.data.annotation.Id;

@Entity
public class EmbeddableTreeNode {
  @Id
  long value;

  EmbeddableTreeNode left;

  EmbeddableTreeNode right;

  Map<String, Long> longValues;

  Map<String, List<Timestamp>> listTimestamps;

  public EmbeddableTreeNode(long value, EmbeddableTreeNode left, EmbeddableTreeNode right) {
    this.value = value;
    this.left = left;
    this.right = right;
  }
}
----

===== Maps

Maps will be stored as embedded entities where the key values become the field names in the embedded entity.
The value types in these maps can be any regularly supported property type, and the key values will be converted to String using the configured converters.

Also, a collection of entities can be embedded; it will be converted to `ListValue` on write.

Example:

Instead of a binary tree from the previous example, we would like to store a general tree
(each node can have an arbitrary number of children) in Cloud Datastore.
To do that, we need to create a field of type `List<EmbeddableTreeNode>`:

[source, java]
----
import org.springframework.cloud.gcp.data.datastore.core.mapping.Embedded;
import org.springframework.data.annotation.Id;

public class EmbeddableTreeNode {
  @Id
  long value;

  List<EmbeddableTreeNode> children;

  Map<String, EmbeddableTreeNode> siblingNodes;

  Map<String, Set<EmbeddableTreeNode>> subNodeGroups;

  public EmbeddableTreeNode(List<EmbeddableTreeNode> children) {
    this.children = children;
  }
}
----

Because Maps are stored as entities, they can further hold embedded entities:

- Singular embedded objects in the value can be stored in the values of embedded Maps.
- Collections of embedded objects in the value can also be stored as the values of embedded Maps.
- Maps in the value are further stored as embedded entities with the same rules applied recursively for their values.


==== Ancestor-Descendant Relationships

Parent-child relationships are supported via the `@Descendants` annotation.

Unlike embedded children, descendants are fully-formed entities residing in their own kinds.
The parent entity does not have an extra field to hold the descendant entities.
Instead, the relationship is captured in the descendants' keys, which refer to their parent entities:

[source, java]
----
import org.springframework.cloud.gcp.data.datastore.core.mapping.Descendants;
import org.springframework.cloud.gcp.data.datastore.core.mapping.Entity;
import org.springframework.data.annotation.Id;

@Entity("orders")
public class ShoppingOrder {
  @Id
  long id;

  @Descendants
  List<Item> items;
}

@Entity("purchased_item")
public class Item {
  @Id
  Key purchasedItemKey;

  String name;

  Timestamp timeAddedToOrder;
}
----

For example, an instance of a GQL key-literal representation for `Item` would also contain the parent `ShoppingOrder` ID value:

----
Key(orders, '12345', purchased_item, 'eggs')
----

The GQL key-literal representation for the parent `ShoppingOrder` would be:

----
Key(orders, '12345')
----

The Cloud Datastore entities exist separately in their own kinds.


The `ShoppingOrder`:

----
{
  "id" : 12345
}
----


The two items inside that order:

----
{
  "purchasedItemKey" : Key(orders, '12345', purchased_item, 'eggs'),
  "name" : "eggs",
  "timeAddedToOrder" : "2014-09-27 12:30:00.45-8:00"
}

{
  "purchasedItemKey" : Key(orders, '12345', purchased_item, 'sausage'),
  "name" : "sausage",
  "timeAddedToOrder" : "2014-09-28 11:30:00.45-9:00"
}
----

The parent-child relationship structure of objects is stored in Cloud Datastore using Datastore's https://cloud.google.com/datastore/docs/concepts/entities#ancestor_paths[ancestor relationships].
Because the relationships are defined by the Ancestor mechanism, there is no extra column needed in either the parent or child entity to store this relationship.
The relationship link is part of the descendant entity's key value.
These relationships can be many levels deep.

Properties holding child entities must be collection-like, but they can be any of the supported inter-convertible collection-like types that are supported for regular properties such as `List`, arrays, `Set`, etc...
Child items must have `Key` as their ID type because Cloud Datastore stores the ancestor relationship link inside the keys of the children.

Reading or saving an entity automatically causes all subsequent levels of children under that entity to be read or saved, respectively.
If a new child is created and added to a property annotated `@Descendants` and the key property is left null, then a new key will be allocated for that child.
The ordering of the retrieved children may not be the same as the ordering in the original property that was saved.

Child entities cannot be moved from the property of one parent to that of another unless the child's key property is set to `null` or a value that contains the new parent as an ancestor.
Since Cloud Datastore entity keys can have multiple parents, it is possible that a child entity appears in the property of multiple parent entities.
Because entity keys are immutable in Cloud Datastore, to change the key of a child you must delete the existing one and re-save it with the new key.


==== Key Reference Relationships

General relationships can be stored using the `@Reference` annotation.

[source, java]
----
import org.springframework.data.annotation.Reference;
import org.springframework.data.annotation.Id;

@Entity
public class ShoppingOrder {
  @Id
  long id;

  @Reference
  List<Item> items;

  @Reference
  Item specialSingleItem;
}

@Entity
public class Item {
  @Id
  Key purchasedItemKey;

  String name;

  Timestamp timeAddedToOrder;
}
----

`@Reference` relationships are between fully-formed entities residing in their own kinds.
The relationship between `ShoppingOrder` and `Item` entities are stored as a Key field inside `ShoppingOrder`, which are resolved to the underlying Java entity type by Spring Data Cloud Datastore:

----
{
  "id" : 12345,
  "specialSingleItem" : Key(item, "milk"),
  "items" : [ Key(item, "eggs"), Key(item, "sausage") ]
}

----

Reference properties can either be singular or collection-like.
These properties correspond to actual columns in the entity and Cloud Datastore Kind that hold the key values of the referenced entities.
The referenced entities are full-fledged entities of other Kinds.

Similar to the `@Descendants` relationships, reading or writing an entity will recursively read or write all of the referenced entities at all levels.
If referenced entities have `null` ID values, then they will be saved as new entities and will have ID values allocated by Cloud Datastore.
There are no requirements for relationships between the key of an entity and the keys that entity holds as references.
The order of collection-like reference properties is not preserved when reading back from Cloud Datastore.


=== Datastore Operations & Template

`DatastoreOperations` and its implementation, `DatastoreTemplate`, provides the Template pattern familiar to Spring developers.

Using the auto-configuration provided by Spring Boot Starter for Datastore, your Spring application context will contain a fully configured `DatastoreTemplate` object that you can autowire in your application:

[source,java]
----
@SpringBootApplication
public class DatastoreTemplateExample {

	@Autowired
	DatastoreTemplate datastoreTemplate;

	public void doSomething() {
		this.datastoreTemplate.deleteAll(Trader.class);
		//...
		Trader t = new Trader();
		//...
		this.datastoreTemplate.save(t);
		//...
		List<Trader> traders = datastoreTemplate.findAll(Trader.class);
		//...
	}
}
----

The Template API provides convenience methods for:

- Write operations (saving and deleting)
- Read-write transactions

==== GQL Query

In addition to retrieving entities by their IDs, you can also submit queries.

[source,java]
----
  <T> Iterable<T> query(Query<? extends BaseEntity> query, Class<T> entityClass);

  <A, T> Iterable<T> query(Query<A> query, Function<A, T> entityFunc);

  Iterable<Key> queryKeys(Query<Key> query);
----

These methods, respectively, allow querying for:
* entities mapped by a given entity class using all the same mapping and converting features
* arbitrary types produced by a given mapping function
* only the Cloud Datastore keys of the entities found by the query

==== Find by ID(s)

Datstore reading a single entity or multiple entities in a kind.

Using `DatastoreTemplate` you can execute reads, for example:

[source,java]
----
Trader trader = this.datastoreTemplate.findById("trader1", Trader.class);

List<Trader> traders = this.datastoreTemplate.findAllById(Arrays.asList("trader1", "trader2"), Trader.class);

List<Trader> allTraders = this.datastoreTemplate.findAll(Trader.class);
----

Cloud Datastore executes key-based reads with strong consistency, but queries with eventual consistency.
In the example above the first two reads utilize keys, while the third is executed using a query based on the corresponding Kind of `Trader`.


===== Indexes

By default, all fields are indexed.
To disable indexing on a particular field, `@Unindexed` annotation can be used.

Example:
[source, java]
----
import org.springframework.cloud.gcp.data.datastore.core.mapping.Unindexed;

public class ExampleItem {
	long indexedField;

	@Unindexed
	long unindexedField;
}
----

When using queries directly or via Query Methods, Cloud Datastore requires https://cloud.google.com/datastore/docs/concepts/indexes[composite custom indexes] if the select statement is not `SELECT *` or if there is more than one filtering condition in the `WHERE` clause.


===== Read with offsets, limits, and sorting

`DatastoreRepository` and custom-defined entity repositories implement the Spring Data `PagingAndSortingRepository`, which supports offsets and limits using page numbers and page sizes.
Paging and sorting options are also supported in `DatastoreTemplate` by supplying a `DatastoreQueryOptions` to `findAll`.

===== Partial read

This feature is not supported yet.

==== Write / Update

The write methods of `DatastoreOperations` accept a POJO and writes all of its properties to Datastore.
The required Datastore kind and entity metadata is obtained from the given object's actual type.

If a POJO was retrieved from Datastore and its ID value was changed and then written or updated, the operation will occur as if against a row with the new ID value.
The entity with the original ID value will not be affected.

[source, java]
----
Trader t = new Trader();
this.datastoreTemplate.save(t);
----

The `save` method behaves as update-or-insert.

===== Partial Update

This feature is not supported yet.

==== Transactions

Read and write transactions are provided by `DatastoreOperations` via the `performTransaction` method:

[source,java]
----

@Autowired
DatastoreOperations myDatastoreOperations;

public String doWorkInsideTransaction() {
  return myDatastoreOperations.performTransaction(
    transactionDatastoreOperations -> {
      // Work with transactionDatastoreOperations here.
      // It is also a DatastoreOperations object.

      return "transaction completed";
    }
  );
}
----

The `performTransaction` method accepts a `Function` that is provided an instance of a `DatastoreOperations` object.
The final returned value and type of the function is determined by the user.
You can use this object just as you would a regular `DatastoreOperations` with an exception:

- It cannot perform sub-transactions.

Because of Cloud Datastore's consistency guarantees, there are https://cloud.google.com/datastore/docs/concepts/transactions#what_can_be_done_in_a_transaction[limitations] to the operations and relationships among entities used inside transactions.

===== Declarative Transactions with @Transactional Annotation

This feature requires a bean of `DatastoreTransactionManager`, which is provided when using `spring-cloud-gcp-starter-data-datastore`.

`DatastoreTemplate` and `DatastoreRepository` support running methods with the `@Transactional` https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/data-access.html#transaction-declarative[annotation] as transactions.
If a method annotated with `@Transactional` calls another method also annotated, then both methods will work within the same transaction.
`performTransaction` cannot be used in `@Transactional` annotated methods because Cloud Datastore does not support transactions within transactions.

==== Read-Write Support for Maps

You can work with Maps of type `Map<String, ?>` instead of with entity objects by directly reading and writing them to and from Cloud Datastore.

NOTE: This is a different situation than using entity objects that contain Map properties.

The map keys are used as field names for a Datastore entity and map values are converted to Datastore supported types.
Only simple types are supported (i.e. collections are not supported).
Converters for custom value types can be added (see <<Custom types>> section).

Example:
[source,java]
----
Map<String, Long> map = new HashMap<>();
map.put("field1", 1L);
map.put("field2", 2L);
map.put("field3", 3L);

keyForMap = datastoreTemplate.createKey("kindName", "id");

//write a map
datastoreTemplate.writeMap(keyForMap, map);

//read a map
Map<String, Long> loadedMap = datastoreTemplate.findByIdAsMap(keyForMap, Long.class);
----

=== Repositories

{spring-data-commons-ref}/#repositories[Spring Data Repositories] are an abstraction that can reduce boilerplate code.

For example:

[source,java]
----
public interface TraderRepository extends DatastoreRepository<Trader, String> {
}
----

Spring Data generates a working implementation of the specified interface, which can be autowired into an application.

The `Trader` type parameter to `DatastoreRepository` refers to the underlying domain type.
The second type parameter, `String` in this case, refers to the type of the key of the domain type.

[source,java]
----
public class MyApplication {

	@Autowired
	TraderRepository traderRepository;

	public void demo() {

		this.traderRepository.deleteAll();
		String traderId = "demo_trader";
		Trader t = new Trader();
		t.traderId = traderId;
		this.tradeRepository.save(t);

		Iterable<Trader> allTraders = this.traderRepository.findAll();

		int count = this.traderRepository.count();
	}
}

----

Repositories allow you to define custom Query Methods (detailed in the following sections) for retrieving, counting, and deleting based on filtering and paging parameters.
Filtering parameters can be of types supported by your configured custom converters.

==== Query methods by convention

[source, java]
----
public interface TradeRepository extends DatastoreRepository<Trade, String[]> {
  List<Trader> findByAction(String action);

  //throws an exception if no results
  Trader findOneByAction(String action);

  //because of the annotation, returns null if no results
  @Nullable
  Trader getByAction(String action);

  Optional<Trader> getOneByAction(String action);

  int countByAction(String action);

  boolean existsByAction(String action);

  List<Trade> findTop3ByActionAndSymbolAndPriceGreaterThanAndPriceLessThanOrEqualOrderBySymbolDesc(
  			String action, String symbol, double priceFloor, double priceCeiling);

  Page<TestEntity> findByAction(String action, Pageable pageable);

  Slice<TestEntity> findBySymbol(String symbol, Pageable pageable);

  List<TestEntity> findBySymbol(String symbol, Sort sort);
}
----

In the example above the {spring-data-commons-ref}/#repositories.query-methods[query methods] in `TradeRepository` are generated based on the name of the methods using the{spring-data-commons-ref}#repositories.query-methods.query-creation[Spring Data Query creation naming convention].

Cloud Datastore only supports filter components joined by AND, and the following operations:

* `equals`
* `greater than or equals`
* `greater than`
* `less than or equals`
* `less than`
* `is null`

After writing a custom repository interface specifying just the signatures of these methods, implementations are generated for you and can be used with an auto-wired instance of the repository.
Because of Cloud Datastore's requirement that explicitly selected fields must all appear in a composite index together, `find` name-based query methods are run as `SELECT *`.

Delete queries are also supported.
For example, query methods such as `deleteByAction` or `removeByAction` delete entities found by `findByAction`.
Delete queries are executed as separate read and delete operations instead of as a single transaction because Cloud Datastore cannot query in transactions unless ancestors for queries are specified.
As a result, `removeBy` and `deleteBy` name-convention query methods cannot be used inside transactions via either `performInTransaction` or `@Transactional` annotation.

Delete queries can have the following return types:

* An integer type that is the number of entities deleted
* A collection of entities that were deleted
* 'void'

Methods can have `org.springframework.data.domain.Pageable` parameter to control pagination and sorting, or `org.springframework.data.domain.Sort` parameter to control sorting only.
See https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/data-commons/docs/current/reference/html/#repositories.query-methods[Spring Data documentation] for details.

For returning multiple items in a repository method, we support Java collections as well as `org.springframework.data.domain.Page` and `org.springframework.data.domain.Slice`.
If a method's return type is `org.springframework.data.domain.Page`, the returned object will include current page, total number of results and total number of pages.

NOTE: Methods that return `Page` execute an additional query to compute total number of pages.
Methods that return `Slice`, on the other hand, don't execute any additional queries and therefore are much more efficient.

==== Query by example
Query by Example is an alternative querying technique.
It enables dynamic query generation based on a user-provided object. See https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/jpa/docs/current/reference/html/#query-by-example[Spring Data Documentation] for details.

===== Unsupported features:
. Currently, only equality queries are supported (no ignore-case matching, regexp matching, etc.).
. Per-field matchers are not supported.
. Embedded entities matching is not supported.

For example, if you want to find all users with the last name "Smith", you would use the following code:
[source, java]
----
userRepository.findAll(
    Example.of(new User(null, null, "Smith"))
----
`null` fields are not used in the filter by default. If you want to include them, you would use the following code:
[source, java]
----
userRepository.findAll(
    Example.of(new User(null, null, "Smith"), ExampleMatcher.matching().withIncludeNullValues())
----

==== Custom GQL query methods

Custom GQL queries can be mapped to repository methods in one of two ways:

 * `namedQueries` properties file
 * using the `@Query` annotation

===== Query methods with annotation

Using the `@Query` annotation:

The names of the tags of the GQL correspond to the `@Param` annotated names of the method parameters.

[source, java]
----
public interface TraderRepository extends DatastoreRepository<Trader, String> {

  @Query("SELECT * FROM traders WHERE name = @trader_name")
  List<Trader> tradersByName(@Param("trader_name") String traderName);

  @Query("SELECT * FROM  test_entities_ci WHERE id = @id_val")
  TestEntity getOneTestEntity(@Param("id_val") long id);

  @Query("SELECT * FROM traders WHERE name = @trader_name")
  List<Trader> tradersByNameSort(@Param("trader_name") String traderName, Sort sort);

  @Query("SELECT * FROM traders WHERE name = @trader_name")
  Slice<Trader> tradersByNameSlice(@Param("trader_name") String traderName, Pageable pageable);

  @Query("SELECT * FROM traders WHERE name = @trader_name")
  Page<Trader> tradersByNamePage(@Param("trader_name") String traderName, Pageable pageable);
}
----

When the return type is `Slice` or `Pageable`, the result set cursor that points to the position just after the page is preserved in the returned `Slice` or `Page` object. To take advantage of the cursor to query for the next page or slice, use `result.getPageable().next()`.

NOTE: `Page` requires the total count of entities produced by the query. Therefore, the first query will have to retrieve all of the records just to count them. Instead, we recommend using the `Slice` return type, because it does not require an additional count query.

[source, java]
----
 Slice<Trader> slice1 = tradersByNamePage("Dave", PageRequest.of(0, 5));
 Slice<Trader> slice2 = tradersByNamePage("Dave", slice1.getPageable().next());
----

NOTE: You cannot use these Query Methods in repositories where the type parameter is a subclass of another class
annotated with `DiscriminatorField`.

The following parameter types are supported:

* `com.google.cloud.Timestamp`
* `com.google.cloud.datastore.Blob`
* `com.google.cloud.datastore.Key`
* `com.google.cloud.datastore.Cursor`
* `java.lang.Boolean`
* `java.lang.Double`
* `java.lang.Long`
* `java.lang.String`
* `enum` values.
These are queried as `String` values.

With the exception of `Cursor`, array forms of each of the types are also supported.

If you would like to obtain the count of items of a query or if there are any items returned by the query, set the `count = true` or `exists = true` properties of the `@Query` annotation, respectively.
The return type of the query method in these cases should be an integer type or a boolean type.

Cloud Datastore provides provides the `SELECT __key__ FROM ...` special column for all kinds that retrieves the `Key`s of each row.
Selecting this special `__key__` column is especially useful and efficient for `count` and `exists` queries.

You can also query for non-entity types:

[source, java]
----
	@Query(value = "SELECT __key__ from test_entities_ci")
	List<Key> getKeys();

	@Query(value = "SELECT __key__ from test_entities_ci limit 1")
	Key getKey();

	@Query("SELECT id FROM test_entities_ci WHERE id <= @id_val")
	List<String> getIds(@Param("id_val") long id);

	@Query("SELECT id FROM test_entities_ci WHERE id <= @id_val limit 1")
	String getOneId(@Param("id_val") long id);
----

SpEL can be used to provide GQL parameters:

[source, java]
----
@Query("SELECT * FROM |com.example.Trade| WHERE trades.action = @act
  AND price > :#{#priceRadius * -1} AND price < :#{#priceRadius * 2}")
List<Trade> fetchByActionNamedQuery(@Param("act") String action, @Param("priceRadius") Double r);
----


Kind names can be directly written in the GQL annotations.
Kind names can also be resolved from the `@Entity` annotation on domain classes.

In this case, the query should refer to table names with fully qualified class names surrounded by `|` characters: `|fully.qualified.ClassName|`.
This is useful when SpEL expressions appear in the kind name provided to the `@Entity` annotation.
For example:

[source, java]
----
@Query("SELECT * FROM |com.example.Trade| WHERE trades.action = @act")
List<Trade> fetchByActionNamedQuery(@Param("act") String action);
----

===== Query methods with named queries properties

You can also specify queries with Cloud Datastore parameter tags and SpEL expressions in properties files.

By default, the `namedQueriesLocation` attribute on `@EnableDatastoreRepositories` points to the `META-INF/datastore-named-queries.properties` file.
You can specify the query for a method in the properties file by providing the GQL as the value for the "interface.method" property:

NOTE: You cannot use these Query Methods in repositories where the type parameter is a subclass of another class
annotated with `DiscriminatorField`.

[source, properties]
----
Trader.fetchByName=SELECT * FROM traders WHERE name = @tag0
----

[source, java]
----
public interface TraderRepository extends DatastoreRepository<Trader, String> {

	// This method uses the query from the properties file instead of one generated based on name.
	List<Trader> fetchByName(@Param("tag0") String traderName);

}
----

==== Transactions

These transactions work very similarly to those of `DatastoreOperations`, but is specific to the repository's domain type and provides repository functions instead of template functions.

For example, this is a read-write transaction:

[source,java]
----

@Autowired
DatastoreRepository myRepo;

public String doWorkInsideTransaction() {
  return myRepo.performTransaction(
    transactionDatastoreRepo -> {
      // Work with the single-transaction transactionDatastoreRepo here.
      // This is a DatastoreRepository object.

      return "transaction completed";
    }
  );
}
----

==== Projections

Spring Data Cloud Datastore supports {spring-data-commons-ref}/#projections[projections].
You can define projection interfaces based on domain types and add query methods that return them in your repository:

[source, java]
----
public interface TradeProjection {

	String getAction();

	@Value("#{target.symbol + ' ' + target.action}")
	String getSymbolAndAction();
}

public interface TradeRepository extends DatastoreRepository<Trade, Key> {

	List<Trade> findByTraderId(String traderId);

	List<TradeProjection> findByAction(String action);

	@Query("SELECT action, symbol FROM trades WHERE action = @action")
	List<TradeProjection> findByQuery(String action);
}
----

Projections can be provided by name-convention-based query methods as well as by custom GQL queries.
If using custom GQL queries, you can further restrict the fields retrieved from Cloud Datastore to just those required by the projection.
However, custom select statements (those not using `SELECT *`) require composite indexes containing the selected fields.

Properties of projection types defined using SpEL use the fixed name `target` for the underlying domain object.
As a result, accessing underlying properties take the form `target.<property-name>`.

==== REST Repositories

When running with Spring Boot, repositories can be exposed as REST services by simply adding this dependency to your pom file:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
  <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-data-rest</artifactId>
</dependency>
----

If you prefer to configure parameters (such as path), you can use `@RepositoryRestResource` annotation:
[source,java]
----
@RepositoryRestResource(collectionResourceRel = "trades", path = "trades")
public interface TradeRepository extends DatastoreRepository<Trade, String[]> {
}
----

For example, you can retrieve all `Trade` objects in the repository by using `curl \http://<server>:<port>/trades`, or any specific trade via `curl \http://<server>:<port>/trades/<trader_id>`.

You can also write trades using `curl -XPOST -H"Content-Type: application/json" -d@test.json \http://<server>:<port>/trades/` where the file `test.json` holds the JSON representation of a `Trade` object.

To delete trades, you can use `curl -XDELETE \http://<server>:<port>/trades/<trader_id>`

=== Events

Spring Data Cloud Datastore publishes events extending the Spring Framework's `ApplicationEvent` to the context that can be received by `ApplicationListener` beans you register.

[options="header"]
|===
| Type | Description | Contents
| `AfterFindByKeyEvent`|Published immediately after read by-key operations are executed by `DatastoreTemplate`| The entities read from Cloud Datastore and the original keys in the request.
| `AfterQueryEvent`|Published immediately after read byquery operations are executed by `DatastoreTemplate`| The entities read from Cloud Datastore and the original query in the request.
| `BeforeSaveEvent`|Published immediately before save operations are executed by `DatastoreTemplate`| The entities to be sent to Cloud Datastore and the original Java objects being saved.
| `AfterSaveEvent`|Published immediately after save operations are executed by `DatastoreTemplate`| The entities sent to Cloud Datastore  and the original Java objects being saved.
| `BeforeDeleteEvent`|Published immediately before delete operations are executed by `DatastoreTemplate`| The keys to be sent to Cloud Datastore. The target entities, ID values, or entity type originally specified for the delete operation.
| `AfterDeleteEvent`|Published immediately after delete operations are executed by `DatastoreTemplate`| The keys sent to Cloud Datastore. The target entities, ID values, or entity type originally specified for the delete operation.
|===

=== Auditing

Spring Data Cloud Datastore supports the `@LastModifiedDate` and `@LastModifiedBy` auditing annotations for properties:

[source,java]
----
@Entity
public class SimpleEntity {
    @Id
    String id;

    @LastModifiedBy
    String lastUser;

    @LastModifiedDate
    DateTime lastTouched;
}
----

Upon insert, update, or save, these properties will be set automatically by the framework before Datastore entities are generated and saved to Cloud Datastore.

To take advantage of these features, add the `@EnableDatastoreAuditing` annotation to your configuration class and provide a bean for an `AuditorAware<A>` implementation where the type `A` is the desired property type annotated by `@LastModifiedBy`:

[source,java]
----
@Configuration
@EnableDatastoreAuditing
public class Config {

    @Bean
    public AuditorAware<String> auditorProvider() {
        return () -> Optional.of("YOUR_USERNAME_HERE");
    }
}
----

The `AuditorAware` interface contains a single method that supplies the value for fields annotated by `@LastModifiedBy` and can be of any type.
One alternative is to use Spring Security's `User` type:

[source,java]
----
class SpringSecurityAuditorAware implements AuditorAware<User> {

  public Optional<User> getCurrentAuditor() {

    return Optional.ofNullable(SecurityContextHolder.getContext())
			  .map(SecurityContext::getAuthentication)
			  .filter(Authentication::isAuthenticated)
			  .map(Authentication::getPrincipal)
			  .map(User.class::cast);
  }
}
----

You can also set a custom provider for properties annotated `@LastModifiedDate` by providing a bean for `DateTimeProvider` and providing the bean name to `@EnableDatastoreAuditing(dateTimeProviderRef = "customDateTimeProviderBean")`.

=== Spring Boot Actuator Support

==== Cloud Datastore Health Indicator

If you are using Spring Boot Actuator, you can take advantage of the Cloud Datastore health indicator called `datastore`.
The health indicator will verify whether Cloud Datastore is up and accessible by your application.
To enable it, all you need to do is add the https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/htmlsingle/#production-ready[Spring Boot Actuator] to your project.

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-actuator</artifactId>
</dependency>
----
