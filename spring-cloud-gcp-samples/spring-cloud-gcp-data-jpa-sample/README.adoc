= Spring Data JPA with Spring Cloud GCP SQL Sample

This sample application demonstrates how to use
https://projects.spring.io/spring-data-jpa/[Spring Data JPA] with either the link:../../spring-cloud-gcp-starters/spring-cloud-gcp-starter-sql-mysql[Spring Cloud GCP MySQL Starter] or link:../../spring-cloud-gcp-starters/spring-cloud-gcp-starter-sql-postgresql[Spring Cloud GCP PostgreSQL Starter].

We will create an instance, a database within the instance, populate the database and then query it.

You can also explore the GCP MySQL Starter in the https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/cloud-spring-petclinic-cloudsql/index.html[Spring Pet Clinic using Cloud SQL] codelab.

== Setup

1. Follow https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/mysql/quickstart[these instructions] to set up a Google
Cloud Project with billing enabled.

2. Create a Google Cloud SQL instance from the https://console.cloud.google.com/sql/instances[Google Cloud Console Cloud SQL page].

3. Still within the Google Cloud Console SQL page, create a new database in the instance from the
"Databases" section.
If you decided to set a root password for your instance footnoteref:[note, Google Cloud SQL allows for creating MySQL instances without a password, while still remaining safe, as the connection is using Cloud SDK authentication and encrypted communication: see docs on https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/mysql/sql-proxy[Cloud SQL proxy] and https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/mysql/connect-external-app#java[the java socketFactory], which is used in spring-cloud-gcp to create the connection!], then don't forget to take note of your root password, as you will need it in the next step!

4. Open the link:src/main/resources/application.properties[application.properties] file and replace
*[database-name]* with the name of the database you created in step 3 and
*[instance-connection-name]* with the instance connection name of the instance you created in step 1.
+
If you set a root password, add the `spring.datasource.password` property with the root password as the value.

5. https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/auth/application-default/login[If you are authenticated in the Cloud SDK], your credentials will be automatically found by the Spring Boot Starter for Google Cloud SQL.
+
Alternatively, https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/serviceaccounts[create a service account from the Google Cloud Console] and download its private key.
Then, uncomment the `spring.cloud.gcp.sql.credentials.location` property in the link:src/main/resources/application.properties[application.properties] file and fill its value with the path to your service account private key on your local file system, prepended with `file:`.


== Running the application

This application uses the Spring Cloud GCP SQL starter to configure a `JdbcTemplate` object, which the Spring Data JPA starter uses as an input.

This application is runnable by executing the following command from the same directory where the `pom.xml` file is located:

`$ mvn spring-boot:run`

It writes a few house tuples to the database and then reads and prints each house address from the database.

== Running with Cloud SQL (PostgreSQL)

To run the sample with PostgreSQL instead of MySQL, follow the same basic steps, but replace MySQL starter in the `pom.xml` with the PostgreSQL starter, and change the Hibernate dialect in `application.properties` to `PostgreSQL9Dialect`.

In `pom.xml` comment out `spring-cloud-gcp-starter-sql-mysql` and uncomment `spring-cloud-gcp-starter-sql-postgresql`:
[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-cloud-gcp-starter-sql-postgresql</artifactId>
</dependency>
----

In `src/main/resources/application.properties` change the dialect to `PostgreSQL9Dialect`:
----
spring.jpa.database-platform=org.hibernate.dialect.PostgreSQL9Dialect
