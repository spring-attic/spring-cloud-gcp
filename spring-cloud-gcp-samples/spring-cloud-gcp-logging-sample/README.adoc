= Spring Cloud GCP Logging Starter Example

This sample application demonstrates using the
link:../../spring-cloud-gcp-starters/spring-cloud-gcp-starter-logging[Spring Cloud GCP Logging
Starter] to store and group logs by trace ID, with the Google Stackdriver Logging API.

== Setup & Configuration
1. Create a Google Cloud Platform Project
1. Have the https://cloud.google.com/sdk/[Google Cloud SDK] installed, initialized and logged in with
https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/application-default-credentials[application
default credentials].

1. Check that the https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library/logging.googleapis.com/?q=logging[Stackdriver Logging API is enabled].

== Running the Example
Run the sample application from Maven:

----
$ mvn spring-boot:run
----

Then, issue a request containing the `x-cloud-trace-context` header to
the `localhost:8080/log` endpoint and verify that a label appears in Stackdriver:

----
$ curl --header "x-cloud-trace-context: [Some-Trace-ID]" localhost:8080/log
----

To see the logged lines, navigate to the https://console.cloud.google.com/logs/viewer[Logging section of the Cloud Console].
Select the `Global` resource and look under the `spring.log` channel to see the logged text.

If your application is deployed to Google App Engine (GAE) or Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE),
you will instead find the logs under the deployment's resource in the Stackdriver UI under the `spring.log` channel.
You can further narrow down the log by request by using the following filtering text
that takes advantage of the trace ID label in each logged line. For example, if deployed to App Engine
(by using `mvn appengine:deploy` in this sample) you can use the following to filter by the trace ID:

----
resource.type="gae_app"
logName="projects/[Your-Project-ID]/logs/spring.log"
labels."appengine.googleapis.com/trace_id"="[Trace-ID-Of-Request]"
----

Expand the log entry labels and note that `appengine.googleapis.com/trace_id` label is set to the
same value for both log messages. The trace ID header `x-cloud-trace-context` is set automatically when deployed to App Engine.

NOTE: When running on GAE or GKE, also remember to remove the `CONSOLE` appender, otherwise logs
will appear on Cloud Logging in duplicate: once in the `spring.log` stream and once in the `stdout`
stream.
