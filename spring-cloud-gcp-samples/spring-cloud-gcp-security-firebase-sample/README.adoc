= Spring Cloud GCP Firebase Authentication Sample application

This sample application demonstrates how to use link:../../spring-cloud-gcp-starters/spring-cloud-gcp-starter-security-firebase[Spring Cloud GCP Firebase Authentication Starter] to extract user identity from a signed https://firebase.google.com/[Firebase] JWT token.

The application provides a secured controller that can only be reached if a valid JWT token is sent as an HTTP Header.

This sample app provides simple login page using https://github.com/firebase/firebaseui-web[firebase-ui] to fetch the JWT token.

== Pre requisites

1. Create a new firebase project as instructed https://firebase.google.com/docs/web/setup[here]
2. Once you finish the process make sure you configure the following environment variables before running the app:
    a. FIREBASE_CONFIG_API_KEY: Should be your "apiKey" value (you can find it in Firebase console project settings in "Web API Key" field)
    b. FIREBASE_CONFIG_APP_ID: Should be your "appId" value for the application you set up in step 1.

3. Make sure that you are authenticated with `gcloud` and you have set the correct `projectId` to be the same project as your Firebase project.
This app uses default login and will rely on that to extract the `projectId` using the `GcpProjectIdProvider`
4. Go to your Firebase project, select the web application you have created and enable two providers: `Google` and `email`
5. (Optional) : You can add a few users to try this out if you rather not use the Google Provider authentication

== Running

`Make sure you executed steps 2 & 3 from prerequisites section`

----
$ ./mvnw clean spring-boot:run
----

Open your browser at http://localhost:8080

There's a single page app with an `ask` button, if you try to click it you should get an error message.

Also try to access the secure endpoint via curl:

----
curl http://localhost:8080/answer
----

You should get a 403 error.

Now login using the button at the top right corner. You can choose between using a valid Google credential, or a user you have added via the Firebase authentication users menu.

Once you are logged in, you should see a panel with the `curl` command.

Try clicking the button again.

You can also copy the `curl` command and execute it now on your console and you should be able to access the endpoint.
