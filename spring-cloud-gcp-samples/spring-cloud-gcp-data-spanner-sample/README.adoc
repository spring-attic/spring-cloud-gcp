= Spring Cloud GCP Cloud Spanner Starter Example

This code sample demonstrates how to read and write POJOs from Google Cloud Spanner using the Spring
Data Cloud Spanner module link:../../spring-cloud-gcp-starters/spring-cloud-gcp-starter-data-spanner[Spring Cloud GCP Cloud Spanner Starter].

== Running the example


. Create a new Cloud Spanner instance named "spring-demo".
The example application will create the database and tables if they do not already exist.
[start=2]
. https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/auth/application-default/login[If you are authenticated in the Cloud SDK], your credentials will be automatically found by the Spring
Boot Starter for Google Cloud Spanner.
+
Alternatively, https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/serviceaccounts[create a service account from the Google Cloud Console] and download its private key.
+
Then, uncomment the `spring.cloud.gcp.spanner.credentials.location` property in the link:src/main/resources/application.properties[application.properties] file and fill its value with the path to your service account private key on your local file system, prepended with `file:`.

. Run the `SpannerRepositoryExample` or the `SpannerTemplateExample` Spring Boot console apps.
This causes the app to generate sample `Trade` objects filled with some demo data and persists them to the Cloud Spanner table created earlier.
These POJOs are then retrieved and their contents are printed in the browser.

.. To run the SpannerRepositoryExample:

  `mvn spring-boot:run -Dspring-boot.run.arguments=--spanner_repository`

.. To run the SpannerTemplateExample:

  `mvn spring-boot:run -Dspring-boot.run.arguments=--spanner_template`

Note that the sample application, still running, also provides REST endpoints.
For example, you can retrieve all `Trade` objects in the repository by using
`curl http://localhost:8080/trades`, or any specific trade via
`curl http://localhost:8080/trades/<trader_id>,<trade_id>`.
This is achieved using https://projects.spring.io/spring-data-rest/:[Spring Data REST] and the `@RepositoryRestResource` annotation.

You can also write trades using
`curl -XPOST -H"Content-Type: application/json" -d@test.json http://localhost:8080/trades/` where the file `test.json` holds the JSON representation of a `Trade` object.
