= Spring Cloud GCP Stream Binder for Pub/Sub Code Sample

This code sample demonstrates how to use the Spring Cloud Stream binder for Google Cloud Pub/Sub in the legacy (annotation-based), Spring Cloud Stream style. For the modern (functional) style, check out link:../spring-cloud-gcp-pubsub-stream-binder-functional-sample[this sample].

The sample app prompts a user for a message and their user name.
That data is added to a `UserMessage` object, together with the time of message creation, and is sent through Google Cloud Pub/Sub to a sink which simply logs the message.

Additionally, you may specify the setting `throwError` through the app.
If set to true, this will trigger an exception in the message handler and demonstrate how messages will be forwarded to the error channel.

If the topic for the sink and source does not exist, the binder will automatically create them in Google Cloud Pub/Sub based on the values in link:src/main/resources/application.properties[application.properties].

If the group is not specified, an anonymous subscription with the name `anonymous.<topicName>.<randomUUID>` will be generated.

== Running the code sample

1. Configure your credentials and project ID by following link:../../docs/src/main/asciidoc/core.adoc#project-id[these instructions].
+
Alternatively, if you have the https://cloud.google.com/sdk/[Google Cloud SDK] installed and initialized, and are logged in with https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/application-default-credentials[application default credentials], Spring will auto-discover those parameters for you.

2. Set your project ID using the `spring.cloud.gcp.project-id` property in link:src/main/resources/application.properties[application.properties] or use the `gcloud config set project [PROJECT_ID]` Cloud SDK command.

3. In the link:src/main/resources/application.properties[application.properties] file, a topic and group name is already preconfigured for you.
The topic will be created in your account if it does not already exist.
+
Setting the topic name and group allows you to configure error handling for your Pub/Sub binder.
An error handler is configured in link:src/main/java/com/example/SinkExample.java[SinkExample.java].

4. Run the `mvn clean spring-boot:run` in the root of the code sample to get the app running.

5. Browse `localhost:8080`, type in a message and a user name and press the `Post it!` button.

6. Verify in your app's logs that a similar message was posted:
+
`New message received from [USERNAME] at [TIME_MESSAGE_SENT]: [MESSAGE]`
