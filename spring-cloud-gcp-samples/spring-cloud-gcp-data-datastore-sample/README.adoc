= Spring Cloud GCP Cloud Datastore Starter Example

This code sample demonstrates how to read and write POJOs from Google Cloud Datastore using the Spring
Data Cloud Datastore module link:../../spring-cloud-gcp-starters/spring-cloud-gcp-starter-data-datastore[Spring Cloud GCP Cloud Datastore Starter].

== Running the example

. Create a new Cloud Datastore database in your GCP project if this has not already been done to allow
Cloud Datastore to create and store entities.
[start=2]
. https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/auth/application-default/login[If you are authenticated in the Cloud SDK], your credentials will be automatically found by the Spring
Boot Starter for Google Cloud Datastore.
+
Alternatively, https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/serviceaccounts[create a service account from the Google Cloud Console] and download its private key.
+
Then, uncomment the `spring.cloud.gcp.datastore.credentials.location` property in the link:src/main/resources/application.properties[application.properties] file and fill its value with the path to your service account private key on your local file system, prepended with `file:`.

. Run the `DatastoreRepositoryExample` Spring Boot console app.
This causes the app to generate sample `Singer` objects filled with some demo data and persists them to Cloud Datastore.
These POJOs are then retrieved and their contents are printed in the output.
