= Spring Cloud GCP IAP Authentication Example

This sample application demonstrates using link:../../spring-cloud-gcp-starters/spring-cloud-gcp-starter-security-iap[Spring Cloud GCP IAP Authentication Starter] to extract user identity from a pre-authenticated header injected by https://cloud.google.com/iap/[Cloud Identity-Aware Proxy (IAP)].

If you run the sample locally, the following pages will be available:

|===
|URL |Description

|`http://localhost:8080/`
|Unsecured  page.

|`http://localhost:8080/topsecret`
|Secured page requiring non-anonymous authentication.
Prints IAP identity details if authentication passes.

|`http://localhost:8080/headers`
|Unsecured page that can be used for troubleshooting or capturing IAP tokens from a deployed application for local testing (please don't give anyone else access to your IAP token or add this functionality to a real production application).
|===


== Setup & Configuration
1. Create a Google Cloud Platform Project.
1. Have the https://cloud.google.com/sdk/[Google Cloud SDK] installed, initialized and logged in with https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/application-default-credentials[application default credentials] (you can run the sample locally without logging in, but you'll need the credentials to deploy).


== Running the Sample Locally
Run with Maven from the root of this code sample:

----
$ mvn clean spring-boot:run
----

You can then try using `curl` against the paths made available in the sample.

This will work, and pring "No secrets here":

----
$ curl localhost:8080/
----

This will not work, returning Access Denied:

----
$ curl localhost:8080/topsecret
----

It is possible, in principle, to grab a recent JWK token from a deployed application's `/headers` path, and to test locally.
Please take care with your token if you do this.

----
$ curl -H "x-goog-iap-jwt-assertion: [JWK TOKEN]" localhost:8080/topsecret
----


== Deploying the Sample to AppEngine Flexible

The following Maven target will deploy this application to the root of your AppEngine Flexible instance:
----
$ mvn appengine:deploy
----
