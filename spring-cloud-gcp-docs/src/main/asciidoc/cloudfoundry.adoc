== Cloud Foundry

Spring Cloud GCP provides support for Cloud Foundry's
https://docs.pivotal.io/partners/gcp-sb/index.html[GCP Service Broker].
Our Pub/Sub, Spanner, Storage and Stackdriver Trace starters are Cloud Foundry aware and
retrieve properties like project ID, credentials, etc., that are used in auto configuration.

In cases like Pub/Sub's topic and subscription, or Storage's bucket name, where those parameters
are not used in auto configuration, you can fetch them using the VCAP mapping provided by Spring
Boot.
For example, to retrieve the provisioned Pub/Sub topic, you can use the
`vcap.services.mypubsub.credentials.topic_name` property from the application environment.

NOTE: If the same service is bound to the same application more than once, the auto configuration
will not be able to choose among bindings and will not be activated for that service.
