== Spring Cloud Sleuth

https://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-sleuth/[Spring Cloud Sleuth] is an instrumentation framework for Spring Boot
applications. It captures trace informations and can forward trace traces to services like Zipkin for storage and
analysis.

Google Cloud Platform provides its own managed distributed tracing service called
https://cloud.google.com/trace/[Stackdriver Trace]. Instead of running and maintaining your own Zipkin instance and
storage, you can use Stackdriver Trace to store traces, view trace details, generate latency distributions graphs,
and generate performance regression reports.

This Spring Cloud GCP starter can forward Spring Cloud Sleuth traces to Stackdriver Trace without an intermediary
Zipkin server.

Maven coordinates, using Spring Cloud GCP BOM:


[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-cloud-gcp-starter-trace</artifactId>
</dependency>

Gradle coordinates:

[source,subs="normal"]
----
dependencies {
    compile group: 'org.springframework.cloud', name: 'spring-cloud-gcp-starter-trace', version: '{project-version}'
}

You must enable Stackdriver Trace API from the Google Cloud Console in order to capture traces. Navigate to the
https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/api/cloudtrace.googleapis.com/overview[Stackdriver Trace API] for your project
and make sure it’s enabled.

[NOTE]
====
If you are already using a Zipkin server capturing trace information from multiple platform/frameworks, you also use a
https://cloud.google.com/trace/docs/zipkin[Stackdriver Zipkin proxy] to forward those traces to Stackdriver Trace
without modifying existing applications.

=== Spring Boot Starter for Stackdriver Trace
Spring Boot Starter for Stackdriver Trace uses Spring Cloud Sleuth and auto-configures a
https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-sleuth/blob/master/spring-cloud-sleuth-core/src/main/java/org/springframework/cloud/sleuth/SpanReporter.java[SpanReporter]
that sends the Sleuth’s trace information to Stackdriver Trace.

This starter will send traces asynchronously using a buffered trace consumer that auto-flushes when its buffered trace
messages exceed its buffer size or have been buffered for longer than its scheduled delay.

There are several parameters you can use to tune the Stackdriver Trace adapter. All configurations are optional:

|===
| Name | Description | Optional | Default value
| `spring.cloud.gcp.trace.enabled` |
Auto-configure Spring Cloud Sleuth to send traces to Stackdriver Trace. | Yes | `true`
| `spring.cloud.gcp.trace.executor-threads` |
Number of threads to use by the underlying gRPC channel to send the trace request to Stackdriver. |
Yes | `4`
| `spring.cloud.gcp.trace.buffer-size-bytes` |
Buffer size in bytes. Traces will be flushed to Stackdriver when buffered trace messages exceed this
size. | Yes | 1% of Runtime.totalMemory()
| `spring.cloud.gcp.trace.scheduled-delay-seconds` |
Buffered trace messages will be flushed to Stackdriver when buffered longer than scheduled delays
(in seconds) even if the buffered message size didn't exceed the buffer size. | Yes | `10`
| `spring.cloud.gcp.trace.project-id` |
Overrides the project ID from the <<spring-cloud-gcp-core,Spring Cloud GCP Core Module>> | Yes |
| `spring.cloud.gcp.trace.credentials.location` |
Overrides the credentials location from the <<spring-cloud-gcp-core,Spring Cloud GCP Core Module>> |
Yes |
| `spring.cloud.gcp.trace.credentials.scopes` |
Overrides the credentials scopes from the <<spring-cloud-gcp-core,Spring Cloud GCP Core Module>> |
Yes |
|===

You can use core Spring Cloud Sleuth properties to control Sleuth’s sampling rate, etc.
Read https://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-sleuth/[Sleuth documentation] for more information on
Sleuth configurations.

For example, when you are testing to see the traces are going through, you can set the sampling rate
to 100%.

[source]
----
spring.sleuth.sampler.percentage=1                      # Send 100% of the request traces to Stackdriver.
spring.sleuth.web.skipPattern=(^cleanup.*|.+favicon.*)  # Ignore some URL paths.
----

Stackdriver Trace requires the use of 128-bit Trace ID. This starter ignores
`spring.sleuth.traceId128` property and always uses 128-bit Trace ID.
