== Spring Integration

Spring Cloud GCP integrates with Spring Integration by providing channel adapters that connect your
Spring
https://docs.spring.io/spring-integration/reference/html/messaging-channels-section.html#channel[`MessageChannels`]
to Google Cloud Pub/Sub.
This enables messaging between different processes, applications or micro-services backed up by
Google Cloud Pub/Sub.

Maven coordinates, using Spring Cloud GCP BOM:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-integration-gcp</artifactId>
</dependency>
----

Gradle coordinates:

[source,subs="normal"]
----
dependencies {
    compile group: 'org.springframework.cloud', name: 'spring-integration-gcp', version: '{project-version}'
}

=== Channel Adapters for Google Cloud Pub/Sub

==== Inbound channel adapter

`PubSubInboundChannelAdapter` is the inbound channel adapter for GCP Pub/Sub that listens to a GCP
Pub/Sub subscription for new messages.
It converts new messages to an internal Spring
https://docs.spring.io/spring-integration/reference/html/messaging-construction-chapter.html#message[`Message`]
and then sends it to the bound output channel.

To use the inbound channel adapter, a `PubSubInboundChannelAdapter` must be provided and configured
on the user application side.

[source,java]
----
@Bean
public MessageChannel pubsubInputChannel() {
    return new PublishSubscribeChannel();
}

@Bean
public PubSubInboundChannelAdapter messageChannelAdapter(
    @Qualifier("pubsubInputChannel") MessageChannel inputChannel,
    SubscriberFactory subscriberFactory) {
    PubSubInboundChannelAdapter adapter =
        new PubSubInboundChannelAdapter(subscriberFactory, "subscriptionName");
    adapter.setOutputChannel(inputChannel);
    adapter.setAckMode(AckMode.MANUAL);

    return adapter;
}
----

In the example, we first specify the `MessageChannel` where the adapter is going to write incoming
messages to.
The `MessageChannel` implementation isn't important here.
Depending on your use case, you might want to use a `MessageChannel` other than
`PublishSubscribeChannel`.

Then, we declare a `PubSubInboundChannelAdapter` bean.
It requires the channel we just created and a `SubscriberFactory`, which creates `Subscriber`
objects from the Google Cloud Java Client for Pub/Sub.
The Spring Boot starter for GCP Pub/Sub provides a configured `SubscriberFactory`.

It is also possible to set the message acknowledgement mode on the adapter, which is automatic by
default.
On automatic acking, a message is acked with GCP Pub/Sub if the adapter sent it to the channel and
no exceptions were thrown.
If a `RuntimeException` is thrown while the message is processed, then the message is nacked.
On manual acking, the adapter attaches an `AckReplyConsumer` object to the `Message` headers, which
users can extract using the `GcpHeaders.ACKNOWLEDGEMENT` key and use to (n)ack a message.

[source,java]
----
@Bean
@ServiceActivator(inputChannel = "pubsubInputChannel")
public MessageHandler messageReceiver() {
    return message -> {
        LOGGER.info("Message arrived! Payload: " + message.getPayload());
        AckReplyConsumer consumer =
              message.getHeaders().get(GcpHeaders.ACKNOWLEDGEMENT, AckReplyConsumer.class);
        consumer.ack();
    };
}
----

==== Outbound channel adapter

`PubSubMessageHandler` is the outbound channel adapter for GCP Pub/Sub that listens for new messages
on a Spring `MessageChannel`.
It uses `PubSubTemplate` to convert new `Message` instances to the GCP Pub/Sub format and post them
to a GCP Pub/Sub topic.

To use the outbound channel adapter, a `PubSubMessageHandler` bean must be provided and configured
on the user application side.

[source,java]
----
@Bean
@ServiceActivator(inputChannel = "pubsubOutputChannel")
public MessageHandler messageSender(PubSubTemplate pubsubTemplate) {
    return new PubSubMessageHandler(pubsubTemplate, "topicName");
}
----

The provided `PubSubTemplate` contains all the necessary configuration to publish messages to a
GCP Pub/Sub topic.

`PubSubMessageHandler` publishes messages asynchronously by default.
A publish timeout can be configured for synchronous publishing. If none is provided, the adapter
waits indefinitely for a response.

It is possible to set user-defined callbacks for the `publish()` call in `PubSubMessageHandler`
through the `setPublishFutureCallback()` method.
These are useful to process the message ID, in case of success, or the error if any was thrown.
