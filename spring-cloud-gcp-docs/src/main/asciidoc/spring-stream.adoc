== Spring Cloud Stream

Spring Cloud GCP provides a https://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-stream/[Spring Cloud Stream] binder to Google Cloud Pub/Sub.

The provided binder relies on the https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-gcp/tree/master/spring-cloud-gcp-pubsub/src/main/java/org/springframework/cloud/gcp/pubsub/integration[Spring Integration Channel Adapters for Google Cloud Pub/Sub].

=== Overview

This binder binds producers to Google Cloud Pub/Sub topics and consumers to subscriptions.

NOTE: Partitioning and consumer groups are not currently supported by this binder.

=== Configuration

You can configure the Spring Cloud Stream Binder for Google Cloud Pub/Sub to automatically generate the underlying resources, like the Google Cloud Pub/Sub subscriptions for the consumers.
For that, you can use the `spring.cloud.stream.gcp.pubsub.bindings.[CHANNEL-NAME].consumer.auto-create-resources` property, which is turned ON by default.

If automatic resource creation is turned ON and the subscription and the topic do not exist for a consumer, a subscription and a topic will be created with the same name.
For example, for the following configuration, a topic and a subscription called `myConsumer` would be created.

.application.properties
----
spring.cloud.stream.bindings.output.destination=myConsumer

spring.cloud.stream.gcp.pubsub.bindings.output.consumer.auto-create-resources=true
----

If you are using Pub/Sub auto-configuration from the Spring Cloud GCP Pub/Sub Starter, you should refer to the <<pubsub-configuration,configuration>> section for other Pub/Sub parameters.

NOTE: To use this binder with a https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/emulator[running emulator], configure its host and port via
`spring.cloud.gcp.pubsub.emulator-host`.
