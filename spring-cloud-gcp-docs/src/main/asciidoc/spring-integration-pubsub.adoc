=== Channel Adapters for Google Cloud Pub/Sub

The channel adapters for Google Cloud Pub/Sub connect your Spring
https://docs.spring.io/spring-integration/reference/html/messaging-channels-section.html#channel[`MessageChannels`]
to Google Cloud Pub/Sub topics and subscriptions.
This enables messaging between different processes, applications or micro-services backed up by
Google Cloud Pub/Sub.

The Spring Integration Channel Adapters for Google Cloud Pub/Sub are included in the
`spring-cloud-gcp-pubsub` module.

==== Inbound channel adapter

`PubSubInboundChannelAdapter` is the inbound channel adapter for GCP Pub/Sub that listens to a GCP
Pub/Sub subscription for new messages.
It converts new messages to an internal Spring
https://docs.spring.io/spring-integration/reference/html/messaging-construction-chapter.html#message[`Message`]
and then sends it to the bound output channel.

Google Pub/Sub treats message payloads as byte arrays.
So, by default, the inbound channel adapter will construct the Spring `Message` with `byte[]` as the payload.
However, you can change the desired payload type by setting the `payloadType` property of the `PubSubInboundChannelAdapter`.
The `PubSubInboundChannelAdapter` delegates the conversion to the desired payload type to the `PubSubMessageConverter` configured in the `PubSubTemplate`.


To use the inbound channel adapter, a `PubSubInboundChannelAdapter` must be provided and configured
on the user application side.

[source,java]
----
@Bean
public MessageChannel pubsubInputChannel() {
    return new PublishSubscribeChannel();
}

@Bean
public PubSubInboundChannelAdapter messageChannelAdapter(
    @Qualifier("pubsubInputChannel") MessageChannel inputChannel,
    SubscriberFactory subscriberFactory) {
    PubSubInboundChannelAdapter adapter =
        new PubSubInboundChannelAdapter(subscriberFactory, "subscriptionName");
    adapter.setOutputChannel(inputChannel);
    adapter.setAckMode(AckMode.MANUAL);

    return adapter;
}
----

In the example, we first specify the `MessageChannel` where the adapter is going to write incoming messages to.
The `MessageChannel` implementation isn't important here.
Depending on your use case, you might want to use a `MessageChannel` other than `PublishSubscribeChannel`.

Then, we declare a `PubSubInboundChannelAdapter` bean.
It requires the channel we just created and a `SubscriberFactory`, which creates `Subscriber` objects from the Google Cloud Java Client for Pub/Sub.
The Spring Boot starter for GCP Pub/Sub provides a configured `SubscriberFactory`.

The `PubSubInboundChannelAdapter` supports three acknowledgement modes, with `AckMode.AUTO` being the default value;

Automatic acking (`AckMode.AUTO`)

A message is acked with GCP Pub/Sub if the adapter sent it to the channel and no exceptions were thrown.
If a `RuntimeException` is thrown while the message is processed, then the message is nacked.

Automatic acking OK (`AckMode.AUTO_ACK`)

A message is acked with GCP Pub/Sub if the adapter sent it to the channel and no exceptions were thrown.
If a `RuntimeException` is thrown while the message is processed, then the message is neither acked / nor nacked.

This is useful when using the subscription's ack deadline timeout as a retry delivery backoff mechanism.

Manually acking (`AckMode.MANUAL`)

The adapter attaches a `BasicAcknowledgeablePubsubMessage` object to the `Message` headers.
Users can extract the `BasicAcknowledgeablePubsubMessage` using the `GcpPubSubHeaders.ORIGINAL_MESSAGE` key and use it to (n)ack a message.

[source,java]
----
@Bean
@ServiceActivator(inputChannel = "pubsubInputChannel")
public MessageHandler messageReceiver() {
    return message -> {
        LOGGER.info("Message arrived! Payload: " + new String((byte[]) message.getPayload()));
        BasicAcknowledgeablePubsubMessage originalMessage =
              message.getHeaders().get(GcpPubSubHeaders.ORIGINAL_MESSAGE, BasicAcknowledgeablePubsubMessage.class);
        originalMessage.ack();
    };
}
----

==== Outbound channel adapter

`PubSubMessageHandler` is the outbound channel adapter for GCP Pub/Sub that listens for new messages
on a Spring `MessageChannel`.
It uses `PubSubTemplate` to post them to a GCP Pub/Sub topic.

To construct a Pub/Sub representation of the message, the outbound channel adapter needs to convert the Spring `Message` payload to a byte array representation expected by Pub/Sub.
It delegates this conversion to the `PubSubTemplate`.
To customize the conversion, you can specify a `PubSubMessageConverter` in the `PubSubTemplate` that should convert the `Object` payload and headers of the Spring `Message` to a `PubsubMessage`.

To use the outbound channel adapter, a `PubSubMessageHandler` bean must be provided and configured
on the user application side.

[source,java]
----
@Bean
@ServiceActivator(inputChannel = "pubsubOutputChannel")
public MessageHandler messageSender(PubSubTemplate pubsubTemplate) {
    return new PubSubMessageHandler(pubsubTemplate, "topicName");
}
----

The provided `PubSubTemplate` contains all the necessary configuration to publish messages to a
GCP Pub/Sub topic.

`PubSubMessageHandler` publishes messages asynchronously by default.
A publish timeout can be configured for synchronous publishing. If none is provided, the adapter
waits indefinitely for a response.

It is possible to set user-defined callbacks for the `publish()` call in `PubSubMessageHandler`
through the `setPublishFutureCallback()` method.
These are useful to process the message ID, in case of success, or the error if any was thrown.

To override the default destination you can use the `GcpPubSubHeaders.DESTINATION` header.

[source,java]
----

@Autowired
private MessageChannel pubsubOutputChannel;

public void handleMessage(Message<?> msg) throws MessagingException {
    final Message<?> message = MessageBuilder
        .withPayload(msg.getPayload())
        .setHeader(GcpPubSubHeaders.TOPIC, "customTopic").build();
    pubsubOutputChannel.send(message);
}
----

It is also possible to set an SpEL expression for the topic with the `setTopicExpression()` or `setTopicExpressionString()` methods.

==== Header mapping

These channel adapters contain header mappers that allow you to map, or filter out, headers from Spring to Google Cloud Pub/Sub messages, and vice-versa.
By default, the inbound channel adapter maps every header on the Google Cloud Pub/Sub messages to the Spring messages produced by the adapter.
The outbound channel adapter maps every header from Spring messages into Google Cloud Pub/Sub ones, except the ones added by Spring, like headers with key `"id"`, `"timestamp"` and `"gcp_pubsub_acknowledgement"`.
In the process, the outbound mapper also converts the value of the headers into string.

Each adapter declares a `setHeaderMapper()` method to let you further customize which headers you want to map from Spring to Google Cloud Pub/Sub, and vice-versa.

For example, to filter out headers `"foo"`, `"bar"` and all headers starting with the prefix "prefix_", you can use `setHeaderMapper()` along with the `PubSubHeaderMapper` implementation provided by this module.

[source,java]
----
PubSubMessageHandler adapter = ...
...
PubSubHeaderMapper headerMapper = new PubSubHeaderMapper();
headerMapper.setOutboundHeaderPatterns("!foo", "!bar", "!prefix_*", "*");
adapter.setHeaderMapper(headerMapper);
----

NOTE: The order in which the patterns are declared in `PubSubHeaderMapper.setOutboundHeaderPatterns()` and `PubSubHeaderMapper.setInboundHeaderPatterns()` matters.
The first patterns have precedence over the following ones.

In the previous example, the `"*"` pattern means every header is mapped.
However, because it comes last in the list, https://docs.spring.io/spring-integration/api/org/springframework/integration/util/PatternMatchUtils.html#smartMatch-java.lang.String-java.lang.String...-[the previous patterns take precedence].
