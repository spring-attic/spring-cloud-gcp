==== Repository settings

Spring Data Repositories can be configured via the `@EnableSpannerRepositories` annotation on your
main `@Configuration` class.
With our Spring Boot Starter for Spring Data Cloud Spanner, `@EnableSpannerRepositories` is automatically
added.
It is not required to add it to any other class, unless there is a need to override finer
grain configuration parameters provided by
https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-gcp/blob/master/spring-cloud-gcp-data-spanner/src/main/java/org/springframework/cloud/gcp/data/spanner/repository/config/EnableSpannerRepositories.java[`@EnableSpannerRepositories`].

==== Autoconfiguration

Our Spring Boot autoconfiguration creates the following beans available in the Spring application context:

- an instance of `SpannerTemplate`
- an instance of all user defined repositories extending `CrudRepository` or `PagingAndSortingRepository`, when repositories are enabled
- an instance of `DatabaseClient` from the Google Cloud Java Client for Spanner, for convenience and lower level API access


=== Object Mapping

Spring Data Cloud Spanner allows you to map domain POJOs to Cloud Spanner tables via annotations:

[source,java]
----
@Table(name = "traders")
public class Trader {

	@PrimaryKey
	@Column(name = "trader_id")
	String traderId;

	String firstName;

	String lastName;

	@NotMapped
	Double temporaryNumber;
}
----

Spring Data Cloud Spanner will ignore any property annotated with `@NotMapped`. These properties will
not be written to or read from Spanner.

==== Constructors

Simple constructors are supported on POJOs.
The constructor arguments can be a subset of the persistent properties.
Every constructor argument needs to have the same name and type as a persistent property on the entity and the constructor should set the property from the given argument.
Arguments that are not directly set to properties are not supported.

[source,java]
----
@Table(name = "traders")
public class Trader {
	@PrimaryKey
	@Column(name = "trader_id")
	String traderId;

	String firstName;

	String lastName;

	@NotMapped
	Double temporaryNumber;

	public Trader(String traderId, String firstName) {
	    this.traderId = traderId;
	    this.firstName = firstName;
	}
}
----


==== Table

The `@Table` annotation can provide the name of the Cloud Spanner table that stores instances of the annotated class, one per row.
This annotation is optional, and if not given, the name of the table is inferred from the class name with the first character uncapitalized.

===== SpEL expressions for table names

In some cases, you might want the `@Table` table name to be determined dynamically.
To do that, you can use
https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/core.html#expressions[Spring
Expression Language].

For example:

[source, java]
----

@Table(name = "trades_#{tableNameSuffix}")
public class Trade {
	// ...
}
----

The table name will be resolved only if the `tableNameSuffix` value/bean in the Spring application
context is defined.
For example, if `tableNameSuffix` has the value "123", the table name will resolve to `trades_123`.

==== Primary Keys

For a simple table, you may only have a primary key consisting of a single column.
Even in that case, the `@PrimaryKey` annotation is required.
`@PrimaryKey` identifies the one or more ID properties corresponding to the primary key.

Spanner has first class support for composite primary keys of multiple columns.
You have to annotate all of your POJO's fields that the primary key consists of with `@PrimaryKey` as below:

[source,java]
----
@Table(name = "trades")
public class Trade {
	@PrimaryKey(keyOrder = 2)
	@Column(name = "trade_id")
	private String tradeId;

	@PrimaryKey(keyOrder = 1)
	@Column(name = "trader_id")
	private String traderId;

	private String action;

	private Double price;

	private Double shares;

	private String symbol;
}
----

The `keyOrder` parameter of `@PrimaryKey` identifies the properties corresponding to the primary key columns in order, starting with 1 and increasing consecutively.
Order is important and must reflect the order defined in the Cloud Spanner schema.
In our example the DDL to create the table and its primary key is as follows:

[source,sql]
----
CREATE TABLE trades (
    trader_id STRING(MAX),
    trade_id STRING(MAX),
    action STRING(15),
    symbol STRING(10),
    price FLOAT64,
    shares FLOAT64
) PRIMARY KEY (trader_id, trade_id)
----

Spanner does not have automatic ID generation.
For most use-cases, sequential IDs should be used with caution to avoid creating data hotspots in the system.
Read https://cloud.google.com/spanner/docs/schema-and-data-model#primary_keys[Spanner Primary Keys documentation] for a better understanding of primary keys and recommended practices.


==== Columns

All accessible properties on POJOs are automatically recognized as a Cloud Spanner column.
Column naming is generated by the `PropertyNameFieldNamingStrategy` by default defined on the `SpannerMappingContext` bean.
The `@Column` annotation optionally provides a different column name than that of the property.


==== Embedded Objects

If an object of type `B` is embedded as a property of `A`, then the columns of `B` will be saved in
the same Cloud Spanner table as those of `A`. If `B` has primary key columns, those columns will be
included in the primary key of `A`. `B` can also have embedded properties. Embedding allows reuse
of columns between multiple entities, and can be useful for implementing parent-child situations, because
Cloud Spanner requires child tables to include the key columns of their parents.

For example:

[source,java]
----
class X {
  @PrimaryKey
  String grandParentId;

  long age;
}

class A {
  @PrimaryKey
  @Embedded
  X grandParent;

  @PrimaryKey(keyOrder = 2)
  String parentId;

  String value;
}

@Table(name = "items")
class B {
  @PrimaryKey
  @Embedded
  A parent;

  @PrimaryKey(keyOrder = 2)
  String id;

  @Column(name = "child_value")
  String value;
}
----

Entities of `B` can be stored in a table defined as:

[source,sql]
----
CREATE TABLE items (
    grandParentId STRING(MAX),
    parentId STRING(MAX),
    id STRING(MAX),
    value STRING(MAX),
    child_value STRING(MAX),
    age INT64
) PRIMARY KEY (grandParentId, parentId, id)
----

Note that embedded properties' column names must all be unique.


==== Relationships

Spring Data Cloud Spanner supports parent-child relationships using the Cloud Spanner https://cloud.google.com/spanner/docs/schema-and-data-model#creating-interleaved-tables[parent-child interleaved
table mechanism]. Cloud Spanner interleaved tables enforce the one-to-many relationship and provide efficient queries and operations
on entities of a single domain parent entity. These relationships can be up to 7 levels deep. Cloud Spanner also provides
automatic cascading delete or enforces the deletion of child entities before parents.

While one-to-one and many-to-many relationships can be implemented in Cloud Spanner and Spring Data Cloud Spanner using constructs of
interleaved parent-child tables, only the parent-child relationship is natively supported. Cloud Spanner does not
support the foreign key constraint, though the parent-child key constraint enforces a similar requirement when used
with interleaved tables.

For example, the following Java entities:

[source,java]
----
@Table(name = "Singers")
class Singer {
  @PrimaryKey
  long SingerId;

  String FirstName;

  String LastName;

  byte[] SingerInfo;

  @Interleaved
  List<Album> albums;
}

@Table(name = "Albums")
class Album {
  @PrimaryKey
  long SingerId;

  @PrimaryKey(keyOrder = 2)
  long AlbumId;

  String AlbumTitle;
}
----

These classes can correspond to an existing pair of interleaved tables. The `@Interleaved` annotation may be applied to
`Collection` properties and the inner type is resolved as the child entity type. The schema needed to create them can
also be generated using the `SpannerSchemaUtils` and executed using the `SpannerDatabaseAdminTemplate`:

[source,java]
----

@Autowired
SpannerSchemaUtils schemaUtils;

@Autowired
SpannerDatabaseAdminTemplate databaseAdmin;
...

// Get the create statmenets for all tables in the table structure rooted at Singer
List<String> createStrings = this.schemaUtils.getCreateTableDdlStringsForInterleavedHierarchy(Singer.class);

// Create the tables and also create the database if necessary
this.databaseAdmin.executeDdlStrings(createStrings, true);
----

The `createStrings` list contains table schema statements using column names and types compatible with the provided
Java type and any resolved child relationship types contained within based on the configured custom converters.

[source,sql]
----
CREATE TABLE Singers (
  SingerId   INT64 NOT NULL,
  FirstName  STRING(1024),
  LastName   STRING(1024),
  SingerInfo BYTES(MAX),
) PRIMARY KEY (SingerId);

CREATE TABLE Albums (
  SingerId     INT64 NOT NULL,
  AlbumId      INT64 NOT NULL,
  AlbumTitle   STRING(MAX),
) PRIMARY KEY (SingerId, AlbumId),
  INTERLEAVE IN PARENT Singers ON DELETE CASCADE;
----

The `ON DELETE CASCADE` clause indicates that Cloud Spanner will delete all Albums of a singer if the Singer is deleted.
The alternative is `ON DELETE NO ACTION`, where a Singer cannot be deleted until all of its Albums have already been deleted.
When using `SpannerSchemaUtils` to generate the schema strings, the `spring.cloud.gcp.spanner.createInterleavedTableDdlOnDeleteCascade` boolean setting
determines if these schema are generated as "ON DELETE CASCADE" for `true` and "ON DELETE NO ACTION" for `false`.

Cloud Spanner restricts these relationships to 7 child layers. A table may have multiple child tables.

On updating or inserting an object to Cloud Spanner, all of its referenced children objects are also updated or inserted
in the same request, respectively. On read, all of the interleaved child rows are also all read.

==== Supported Types

Spring Data Cloud Spanner supports the following types for regular fields:

* `com.google.cloud.ByteArray`
* `com.google.cloud.Date`
* `com.google.cloud.Timestamp`
* `java.lang.Boolean`, `boolean`
* `java.lang.Double`, `double`
* `java.lang.Long`, `long`
* `java.lang.Integer`, `int`
* `java.lang.String`
* `double[]`
* `long[]`
* `boolean[]`
* `java.util.Date`
* `java.util.Instant`
* `java.sql.Date`


==== Lists

Spanner supports `ARRAY` types for columns.
`ARRAY` columns are mapped to `List` fields in POJOS.

Example:

[source,java]
----
List<Double> curve;
----

Spring Data Spanner supports the following inner types:

* `com.google.cloud.ByteArray`
* `com.google.cloud.Date`
* `com.google.cloud.Timestamp`
* `java.lang.Boolean`, `boolean`
* `java.lang.Double`, `double`
* `java.lang.Long`, `long`
* `java.lang.Integer`, `int`
* `java.lang.String`
* `java.util.Date`
* `java.util.Instant`
* `java.sql.Date`

==== Lists of Structs

Cloud Spanner queries can https://cloud.google.com/spanner/docs/query-syntax#using-structs-with-select[construct STRUCT values]
that appear as columns in the result. Cloud Spanner requires STRUCT values appear in ARRAYs at the
root level: `SELECT ARRAY(SELECT STRUCT(1 as val1, 2 as val2)) as pair FROM Users`.

Spring Data Cloud Spanner
will attempt to read the column STRUCT values into a property that is an `Iterable`
of an entity type compatible with the schema of the column STRUCT value. For example, the following
property can be mapped with the constructed `ARRAY<STRUCT>` column: `List<TwoInts> pair;`
where the `TwoInts` type is defined:
[source, java]
----
class TwoInts {

  int val1;

  int val2;
}
----

==== Custom types

Custom converters can be used extending the type support for user defined types.

. Converters need to implement the `org.springframework.core.convert.converter.Converter` interface in
both directions.
. The user defined type needs to be mapped to one of the basic types supported by Spanner:

* `com.google.cloud.ByteArray`
* `com.google.cloud.Date`
* `com.google.cloud.Timestamp`
* `java.lang.Boolean`, `boolean`
* `java.lang.Double`, `double`
* `java.lang.Long`, `long`
* `java.lang.String`
* `double[]`
* `long[]`
* `boolean[]`

. An instance of both Converters needs to be passed to a `ConverterAwareMappingSpannerEntityProcessor`, which then has
to be made available as a `@Bean` for `SpannerEntityProcessor`.

For example:

We would like to have a field of type `Person` on our `Trade` POJO:
[source, java]
----

@Table(name = "trades")
public class Trade {
  //...
  Person person;
  //...
}
----

Where Person is a simple class:

[source, java]
----
public class Person {

  public String firstName;
  public String lastName;

}
----

We have to define the two converters:

[source, java]
----
  public class PersonWriteConverter implements Converter<Person, String> {

    @Override
    public String convert(Person person) {
      return person.firstName + " " + person.lastName;
    }
  }

  public class PersonReadConverter implements Converter<String, Person> {

    @Override
    public Person convert(String s) {
      Person person = new Person();
      person.firstName = s.split(" ")[0];
      person.lastName = s.split(" ")[1];
      return person;
    }
  }
----

That will be configured in our `@Configuration` file:

[source, java]
----
@Configuration
public class ConverterConfiguration {

	@Bean
	public SpannerEntityProcessor spannerEntityProcessor(SpannerMappingContext spannerMappingContext) {
		return new ConverterAwareMappingSpannerEntityProcessor(spannerMappingContext,
				Arrays.asList(new PersonWriteConverter()),
				Arrays.asList(new PersonReadConverter()));
	}
}
----

==== Custom Converter for Struct Array Columns
If a `Converter<Struct, A>` is provided, then properties of type `List<A>` can be used in your entity types.


=== Spanner Template

`SpannerOperations` and its implementation, `SpannerTemplate`, provides the Template pattern
familiar to Spring developers.
It provides:

 - Resource management
 - One-stop-shop to Spanner operations with the Spring Data POJO mapping and conversion features
 - Exception conversion

Using the `autoconfigure` provided by our Spring Boot Starter for Spanner, your Spring application
context will contain a fully configured `SpannerTemplate` object that you can easily autowire in
your application:

[source,java]
----
@SpringBootApplication
public class SpannerTemplateExample {

	@Autowired
	SpannerTemplate spannerTemplate;

	public void doSomething() {
		this.spannerTemplate.delete(Trade.class, KeySet.all());
		//...
		Trade t = new Trade();
		//...
		this.spannerTemplate.insert(t);
		//...
		List<Trade> tradesByAction = spannerTemplate.findAll(Trade.class);
		//...
	}
}
----

The Template API provides convenience methods for:

- https://cloud.google.com/spanner/docs/reads[Reads], and by providing SpannerReadOptions and
SpannerQueryOptions
   ** Stale read
   ** Read with secondary indices
   ** Read with limits and offsets
   ** Read with sorting
- https://cloud.google.com/spanner/docs/reads#execute_a_query[Queries]
- DML operations (delete, insert, update, upsert)
- Partial reads
   ** You can define a set of columns to be read into your entity
- Partial writes
   ** Persist only a few properties from your entity
- Read-only transactions
- Locking read-write transactions

==== SQL Query

Spanner has SQL support for running read-only queries.
All the query related methods start with `query` on `SpannerTemplate`.
Using `SpannerTemplate` you can execute SQL queries that map to POJOs:

[source,java]
----
List<Trade> trades = this.spannerTemplate.query(Trade.class, Statement.of("SELECT * FROM trades"));
----


==== Read

Spanner exposes a https://cloud.google.com/spanner/docs/reads[Read API] for reading single row or multiple rows in a table or in a secondary index.

Using `SpannerTemplate` you can execute reads, for example:

[source,java]
----
List<Trade> trades = this.spannerTemplate.readAll(Trade.class);
----

Main benefit of reads over queries is reading multiple rows of a certain pattern of keys is much easier using the features of the https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/google-cloud-java/blob/master/google-cloud-spanner/src/main/java/com/google/cloud/spanner/KeySet.java[`KeySet`] class.


==== Advanced reads

===== Stale read

All reads and queries are *strong reads* by default.
A *strong read* is a read at a current timestamp and is guaranteed to see all data that has been committed up until the start of this read.
A *stale read* on the other hand is read at a timestamp in the past.
Cloud Spanner allows you to determine how current the data should be when you read data.
With `SpannerTemplate` you can specify the `Timestamp` by setting it on `SpannerQueryOptions` or `SpannerReadOptions` to the appropriate read or query methods:

Reads:

[source,java]
----
// a read with options:
SpannerReadOptions spannerReadOptions = new SpannerReadOptions().setTimestamp(Timestamp.now());
List<Trade> trades = this.spannerTemplate.readAll(Trade.class, spannerReadOptions);
----

Queries:

[source,java]
----
// a query with options:
SpannerQueryOptions spannerQueryOptions = new SpannerQueryOptions().setTimestamp(Timestamp.now());
List<Trade> trades = this.spannerTemplate.query(Trade.class, Statement.of("SELECT * FROM trades"), spannerQueryOptions);
----


===== Read from a secondary index

Using a https://cloud.google.com/spanner/docs/secondary-indexes[secondary index] is available for Reads via the Template API and it is also implicitly available via SQL for Queries.

The following shows how to read rows from a table using a https://cloud.google.com/spanner/docs/secondary-indexes[secondary index] simply by setting `index` on `SpannerReadOptions`:

[source,java]
----
SpannerReadOptions spannerReadOptions = new SpannerReadOptions().setIndex("TradesByTrader");
List<Trade> trades = this.spannerTemplate.readAll(Trade.class, spannerReadOptions);
----


===== Read with offsets and limits

Limits and offsets are only supported by Queries.
The following will get only the first two rows of the query:

[source,java]
----
SpannerQueryOptions spannerQueryOptions = new SpannerQueryOptions().setLimit(2).setOffset(3);
List<Trade> trades = this.spannerTemplate.query(Trade.class, Statement.of("SELECT * FROM trades"), spannerQueryOptions);
----

Note that the above is equivalent of executing `SELECT * FROM trades LIMIT 2 OFFSET 3`.

===== Sorting

Reads don't support sorting.
Queries on the Template API support sorting through standard SQL and also via Spring Data Sort API:

[source,java]
----
List<Trade> trades = this.spannerTemplate.queryAll(Trade.class, Sort.by("action"));
----

If the provided sorted field name is that of a property of the domain type, then the column name corresponding to that
property will be used in the query. Otherwise, the given field name is assumed to be the name of the column in the
Cloud Spanner table.
Sorting on columns of Cloud Spanner types STRING and BYTES can be done while ignoring case:

[source,java]
----
Sort.by(Order.desc("action").ignoreCase())
----


===== Partial read

Partial read is only possible when using Queries. In case the rows returned by the query have fewer columns than the entity that it will be mapped to, Spring Data will map the returned columns only.
This setting also applies to nested structs and their corresponding nested POJO properties.

[source,java]
----
List<Trade> trades = this.spannerTemplate.query(Trade.class, Statement.of("SELECT action, symbol FROM trades"),
    new SpannerQueryOptions().setAllowMissingResultSetColumns(true));
----

If the setting is set to `false`, then an exception will be thrown if there are missing columns in the query result.

===== Summary of options for Query vs Read

|===
| Feature | Query supports it | Read supports it
| SQL  | yes | no
| Partial read | yes | no
| Limits | yes | no
| Offsets | yes | no
| Secondary index | yes | yes
| Read using index range | no | yes
| Sorting | yes | no
|===

==== Write / Update

The write methods of `SpannerOperations` accept a POJO and writes all of its properties to Spanner.
The corresponding Spanner table and entity metadata is obtained from the given object's actual type.

If a POJO was retrieved from Spanner and its primary key properties values were changed and then
written or updated, the operation will occur as if against a row with the new primary key values. The row with the
original primary key values will not be affected.

===== Insert

The `insert` method of `SpannerOperations` accepts a POJO and writes all of its properties to Spanner,
which means the operation will fail if a row with the POJO's primary key already exists in the table.

[source, java]
----
Trade t = new Trade();
this.spannerTemplate.insert(t);
----

===== Update

The `update` method of `SpannerOperations` accepts a POJO and writes all of its properties to Spanner,
which means the operation will fail if the POJO's primary key does not already exist in the table.

[source, java]
----
// t was retrieved from a previous operation
this.spannerTemplate.update(t);
----

===== Upsert

The `upsert` method of `SpannerOperations` accepts a POJO and writes all of its properties to Spanner
using update-or-insert.

[source, java]
----
// t was retrieved from a previous operation or it's new
this.spannerTemplate.upsert(t);
----

===== Partial Update

The update methods of `SpannerOperations` operate by default on all properties within the given object,
but also accept `String[]` and `Optional<Set<String>>` of column names. If the `Optional` of set of
column names is empty, then all columns are written to Spanner. However, if the Optional is occupied
by an empty set, then no columns will be written.


[source, java]
----
// t was retrieved from a previous operation or it's new
this.spannerTemplate.update(t, "symbol", "action");
----

==== Transactions

`SpannerOperations` provides methods to run `java.util.Function` objects within a single transaction
while making available the read and write methods from `SpannerOperations`.

===== Read/Write Transaction

Read and write transactions are provided by `SpannerOperations` via the `performReadWriteTransaction` method:

[source,java]
----

@Autowired
SpannerOperations mySpannerOperations;

public String doWorkInsideTransaction() {
  return mySpannerOperations.performReadWriteTransaction(
    transActionSpannerOperations -> {
      // work with transActionSpannerOperations here. It is also a SpannerOperations object.

      return "transaction completed";
    }
  );
}
----

The `performReadWriteTransaction` method accepts a `Function` that is provided an instance of a
`SpannerOperations` object. The final returned value and type of the function is determined by the user.
You can use this object just as you would a regular `SpannerOperations` with
a few exceptions:

- Its read functionality cannot perform stale reads, because all reads and writes happen at the single
point in time of the transaction.
- It cannot perform sub-transactions via `performReadWriteTransaction` or `performReadOnlyTransaction`.

As these read-write transactions are locking, it is recommended that you use the `performReadOnlyTransaction`
if your function does not perform any writes.

===== Read-only Transaction

The `performReadOnlyTransaction` method is used to perform read-only transactions using a `SpannerOperations`:

[source,java]
----

@Autowired
SpannerOperations mySpannerOperations;

public String doWorkInsideTransaction() {
  return mySpannerOperations.performReadOnlyTransaction(
    transActionSpannerOperations -> {
      // work with transActionSpannerOperations here. It is also a SpannerOperations object.

      return "transaction completed";
    }
  );
}
----

The `performReadOnlyTransaction` method accepts a `Function` that is provided an instance of a
`SpannerOperations` object. This method also accepts a `ReadOptions` object, but the only
attribute used is the timestamp used to determine the snapshot in time to perform the reads in
the transaction. If the timestamp is not set in the read options the transaction is run against
the current state of the database.
The final returned value and type of the function is determined by the user.
You can use this object just as you would a regular `SpannerOperations` with
a few exceptions:

- Its read functionality cannot perform stale reads, because all reads happen at the single
point in time of the transaction.
- It cannot perform sub-transactions via `performReadWriteTransaction` or `performReadOnlyTransaction`
- It cannot perform any write operations.

Because read-only transactions are non-locking and can be performed on points in time in the past, these
are recommended for functions that do not perform write operations.

===== Declarative transaction management

To use `@Transactional` in [declarative spring transaction management](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/data-access.html#transaction-declarative)
`SpannerTransactionManager` has to be registered in Spring.

Example:
```
@Bean
public SpannerTransactionManager transactionManager() {
    return new SpannerTransactionManager(databaseClient)
}
```

`SpannerTemplate` respects SpannerTransactionManager and transaction boundaries set by `@Transactional` annotation.

=== Repositories


{spring-data-commons-ref}/#repositories[Spring Data Repositories] are a powerful abstraction that
can save you a lot of boilerplate code.

For example:

[source,java]
----
public interface TraderRepository extends CrudRepository<Trader, String> {
}
----

Spring Data generates a working implementation of the specified interface, which can be conveniently
autowired into an application.

The `Trader` type parameter to `CrudRepository` refers to the underlying domain type.
The second type parameter, `String` in this case, refers to the type of the key of the domain
type.


For POJOs with a composite primary key, this ID type parameter can be any
descendant of `Object[]` compatible with all primary key properties, any descendant of `Iterable`,
or `com.google.cloud.spanner.Key`. If the domain POJO type only has a single primary key column,
then the primary key property type can be used or the `Key` type.

For example in case of Trades, that belong to a Trader, `TradeRepository` would look like this:

[source,java]
----
public interface TradeRepository extends CrudRepository<Trade, String[]> {

}
----

[source,java]
----
public class MyApplication {

	@Autowired
	SpannerOperations spannerTemplate;

	@Autowired
	StudentRepository studentRepository;

	public void demo() {

		this.tradeRepository.deleteAll(); //defined on CrudRepository
		String traderId = "demo_trader";
		Trade t = new Trade();
		t.symbol = stock;
		t.action = action;
		t.traderId = traderId;
		t.price = 100.0;
		t.shares = 12345.6;
		this.spannerTemplate.insert(t); //defined on CrudRepository

		Iterable<Trade> allTrades = this.tradeRepository.findAll(); //defined on CrudRepository

		int count = this.tradeRepository.countByAction("BUY");

	}
}

----

==== CRUD Repository

`CrudRepository` methods work as expected, with one thing Spanner specific: the `save` and `saveAll` methods work as update-or-insert.

==== Paging and Sorting Repository

You can also use `PagingAndSortingRepository` with Spanner Spring Data. The sorting and pageable `findAll`
methods available from this interface operate on the current state of the Spanner database. As a
result, beware that the state of the database (and the results) might change when moving page to page.

==== Spanner Repository

The `SpannerRepository` extends the `PagingAndSortingRepository`, but adds the read-only and the read-write
transaction functionality provided by Spanner. These transactions work very similarly to
those of `SpannerOperations`, but is specific to the repository's domain type and provides repository functions
instead of template functions.

For example, this is a read-write transaction:

[source,java]
----

@Autowired
SpannerRepository myRepo;

public String doWorkInsideTransaction() {
  return myRepo.performReadOnlyTransaction(
    transactionSpannerRepo -> {
      // work with the single-transaction transactionSpannerRepo here. This is a SpannerRepository object.

      return "transaction completed";
    }
  );
}
----

==== Query methods by convention

[source, java]
----
public interface TradeRepository extends CrudRepository<Trade, String[]> {
    List<Trade> findByAction(String action);

	int countByAction(String action);

	// Named methods are powerful, but can get unwieldy
	List<Trade> findTop3DistinctByActionAndSymbolIgnoreCaseOrTraderIdOrderBySymbolDesc(
  			String action, String symbol, String traderId);
}
----

In the example above, the {spring-data-commons-ref}/#repositories.query-methods[query methods]
in `TradeRepository` are generated based on the name of the methods, using the
{spring-data-commons-ref}#repositories.query-methods.query-creation[Spring Data Query creation
naming convention].

`List<Trade> findByAction(String action)` would translate to a `SELECT * FROM trades WHERE action = ?`.

The function `List<Trade> findTop3DistinctByActionAndSymbolIgnoreCaseOrTraderIdOrderBySymbolDesc(String action, String symbol, String traderId);` will be translated as the equivalent of this SQL query:

[source, sql]
----
SELECT DISTINCT * FROM trades
WHERE ACTION = ? AND LOWER(SYMBOL) = LOWER(?) AND TRADER_ID = ?
ORDER BY SYMBOL DESC
LIMIT 3
----

Note that the phrase `SymbolIgnoreCase` is translated to `LOWER(SYMBOL) = LOWER(?)` indicating
a non-case-sensitive matching. The `IgnoreCase` phrase may only be appended to fields that correspond
to columns of type STRING or BYTES.
The Spring Data "AllIgnoreCase" phrase appended at the end of the method name is not supported.

The `Like` or `NotLike` naming conventions:
[source, java]
----
List<Trade> findBySymbolLike(String symbolFragment);
----
The param `symbolFragment` can contain https://cloud.google.com/spanner/docs/functions-and-operators#comparison-operators[wildcard characters]
for string matching such as `_` and `%`.

The `Contains` and `NotContains` naming conventions:
[source, java]
----
List<Trade> findBySymbolContains(String symbolFragment);
----
The param `symbolFragment` is a https://cloud.google.com/spanner/docs/functions-and-operators#regexp_contains[regular expression] that is checked for occurrences.

==== Custom SQL query methods

The example above for `List<Trade> fetchByActionNamedQuery(String action)` does not match the
{spring-data-commons-ref}#repositories.query-methods.query-creation[Spring Data Query creation
naming convention], so we have to map a parametrized Spanner SQL query to it.

The SQL query for the method can be mapped to repository methods in one of two ways:

 * `namedQueries` properties file
 * using the `@Query` annotation

The names of the tags of the SQL correspond to the `@Param` annotated names of the method parameters.

Custom SQL query methods can accept a single `Sort` or `Pageable` parameter that is applied on top
of any sorting or paging in the SQL:

[source, properties]
----
	@Query("SELECT * FROM trades ORDER BY action DESC")
	List<Trade> sortedTrades(Pageable pageable);
----

This can be used:

[source, properties]
----
	List<Trade> customSortedTrades = tradeRepository.sortedTrades(PageRequest
  				.of(2, 2, org.springframework.data.domain.Sort.by(Order.asc("id"))));
----

The results would be sorted by "id" in ascending order.


===== Query methods with named queries properties

By default, the `namedQueriesLocation` attribute on `@EnableSpannerRepositories` points to the
`META-INF/spanner-named-queries.properties` file.
You can specify the query for a method in the properties file by providing the SQL as the value for
the "interface.method" property:

[source, properties]
----
Trade.fetchByActionNamedQuery=SELECT * FROM trades WHERE trades.action = @tag0
----

[source, java]
----
public interface TradeRepository extends CrudRepository<Trade, String[]> {
	// This method uses the query from the properties file instead of one generated based on name.
	List<Trade> fetchByActionNamedQuery(@Param("tag0") String action);
}
----
===== Query methods with annotation

Using the `@Query` annotation:

[source, java]
----
public interface TradeRepository extends CrudRepository<Trade, String[]> {
    @Query("SELECT * FROM trades WHERE trades.action = @tag0")
    List<Trade> fetchByActionNamedQuery(@Param("tag0") String action);
}
----

Table names can be used directly.
For example, "trades" in the above example.
Alternatively, table names can be resolved from the `@Table` annotation on domain classes as well.
In this case, the query should refer to table names with fully qualified class names between `:`
characters: `:fully.qualified.ClassName:`.
A full example would look like:

[source, java]
----
@Query("SELECT * FROM :com.example.Trade: WHERE trades.action = @tag0")
List<Trade> fetchByActionNamedQuery(String action);
----

This allows table names evaluated with SpEL to be used in custom queries.

SpEL can also be used to provide SQL parameters:

[source, java]
----
@Query("SELECT * FROM :com.example.Trade: WHERE trades.action = @tag0
  AND price > #{#priceRadius * -1} AND price < #{#priceRadius * 2}")
List<Trade> fetchByActionNamedQuery(String action, Double priceRadius);
----

Parameters can also be of type `Struct` or POJO type. If a POJO is given as a parameter, it
will be converted to a Struct with the same type-conversion logic as used to create write mutations.
Comparisons using Struct parameters are limited to https://cloud.google.com/spanner/docs/data-types#limited-comparisons-for-struct[what is available with Cloud Spanner].

==== Projections
Spring Data Spanner supports {spring-data-commons-ref}/#projections[projections]. You can define projection interfaces based
on domain types and add query methods that return them in your repository:

[source, java]
----
public interface TradeProjection {

	String getAction();

	@Value("#{target.symbol + ' ' + target.action}")
	String getSymbolAndAction();
}

public interface TradeRepository extends SpannerRepository<Trade, Key> {

	List<Trade> findByTraderId(String traderId);

	List<TradeProjection> findByAction(String action);

	@Query("SELECT action, symbol FROM trades WHERE action = @action")
	List<TradeProjection> findByQuery(String action);
}
----

Projections can be provided by name-convention-based query methods as well as by custom SQL queries.
If using custom SQL queries, you can further restrict the columns retrieved from Spanner to just
those required by the projection to improve performance.

Properties of projection types defined using SpEL use the fixed name `target` for the underlying
domain object. As a result accessing underlying properties take the form `target.<property-name>`.

==== REST Repositories

When running with Spring Boot, repositories can act as REST services by simply annotating them:

[source,java]
----
@RepositoryRestResource(collectionResourceRel = "trades", path = "trades")
public interface TradeRepository extends CrudRepository<Trade, String[]> {
}
----

The `@RepositoryRestResource` annotation makes this repository available via REST.
For example, you can retrieve all `Trade` objects in the repository by using
`curl \http://<server>:<port>/trades`, or any specific trade via
`curl \http://<server>:<port>/trades/<trader_id>,<trade_id>`.

The separator between your primary key components, `id` and `trader_id` in this case, is a comma
by default, but can be configured to any string not found in your key values by extending the
`SpannerKeyIdConverter` class:

[source,java]
----
@Component
class MySpecialIdConverter extends SpannerKeyIdConverter {

    @Override
    protected String getUrlIdSeparator() {
        return ":";
    }
}
----


You can also write trades using
`curl -XPOST -H"Content-Type: application/json" -d@test.json \http://<server>:<port>/trades/`
where the file `test.json` holds the JSON representation of a `Trade` object.

Include this dependency in your `pom.xml` to enable Spring Data REST Repositories:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
  <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-data-rest</artifactId>
</dependency>
----

=== Database and Schema Admin

Databases and tables inside Spanner instances can be created automatically from `SpannerPersistentEntity` objects:

[source,java]
----
@Autowired
private SpannerSchemaUtils spannerSchemaUtils;

@Autowired
private SpannerDatabaseAdminTemplate spannerDatabaseAdminTemplate;

public void createTable(SpannerPersistentEntity entity) {
	if(!spannerDatabaseAdminTemplate.tableExists(entity.tableName()){

	  // The boolean parameter indicates that the database will be created if it does not exist.
	  spannerDatabaseAdminTemplate.executeDdlStrings(Arrays.asList(
            spannerSchemaUtils.getCreateTableDDLString(entity.getType())), true);
	}
}
----
