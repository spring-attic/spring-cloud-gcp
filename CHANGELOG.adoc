== 1.2.3.RELEASE (2020-05-29)

=== General

* Upgrade to latest libraries bom and sql socket factory (https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-gcp/issues/2373[#2373])
* Make transaction managers conditional on enabled flag for Spanner and Datastore (https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-gcp/issues/2376[#2376])

=== Logging

NOTE: As we upgraded to the latest version of `google-cloud-logging-logback`, we picked up a https://github.com/googleapis/java-logging-logback/pull/43[breaking change] where the log entry payload is now written in JSON rather than plain text.
So, if you're reading log entries back from Cloud Logging using `LogEntry.getPayload()`, make sure to cast the returned payload object to `JsonPayload` instead of `StringPayload`.
