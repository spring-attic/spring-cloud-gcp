Provides adapters for Spring Messaging channels to exchange messages via Google Cloud Pub/Sub.
Makes extensive use of the constructs provided by the Spring Cloud GCP Pub/Sub module, like
`PubSubOperations`.

The outbound channel adapter, `PubSubMessageHandler`, publishes messages asynchronously by default.
A publish timeout can be configured for synchronous publishing. If none is provided, the adapter
waits indefinitely for a response.

It is possible to set user-defined callbacks for the `publish()` call in `PubSubMessageHandler`
through the `setPublishFutureCallback()` method.
These are useful to process the message ID, in case of success, or the error if any was thrown.

Refer to the https://spring.io/guides/gs/spring-cloud-gcp/[Spring getting started guide] to learn
how to use the adapters.
