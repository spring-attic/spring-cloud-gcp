= Spring Framework on Google Cloud Platform

This project aims at making it as seamless as possible for Spring users to run their applications on
Google Cloud Platform. The project website is http://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-gcp/ (under
development).

Currently, this repository contains Spring Integration inbound and outbound channel adapters which
use Google Cloud Pub/Sub, as well as a Google Cloud Pub/Sub Spring abstraction, i.e.,
`PubSubTemplate`.
