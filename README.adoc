== Spring Milestones Maven Repository

Currently, the Maven artifacts for the project are only available in the Spring Milestones repository.
You will want to make sure that the repository is added to your `pom.xml` file or globally in your https://maven.apache.org/settings.html[`settings.xml`] file.

== Spring Cloud GCP Bill of Materials (BOM)

If you're a Maven user, it's probably a good idea to add our BOM to your maven.xml
`<dependencyManagement>` section. This will allow you to not specify versions for any of the Maven
dependencies and instead delegate versioning to the BOM.

[source,xml]
----
<dependencyManagement>
    <dependencies>
        <dependency>
            <groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
            <artifactId>spring-cloud-gcp-dependencies</artifactId>
            <version>1.0.0.M2</version>
            <type>pom</type>
            <scope>import</scope>
        </dependency>
    </dependencies>
</dependencyManagement>

== Spring Boot Starters

Spring Boot greatly simplifies the Spring Cloud GCP experience. Our starters handle the object
instantiation and configuration logic so you don't have to.

Every starter depends on the GCP starter to provide critical bits of configuration, like the
GCP project ID or OAuth2 credentials location. You can configure these as properties in, for
example, a properties file:

[source, yaml]
----
spring.cloud.gcp.project-id=[YOUR_GCP_PROJECT_ID]
spring.cloud.gcp.credentials.location=file:[LOCAL_PRIVATE_KEY_FILE]
spring.cloud.gcp.credentials.scopes=[SCOPE_1],[SCOPE_2],[SCOPE_3]
----

These properties are optional and, if not specified, Spring Boot will attempt to automatically find
them for you. For details on how Spring Boot finds these properties, refer to the desired starter
README.

NOTE: If your app is running on Google App Engine or Google Compute Engine, in most cases, you should omit
the `spring.cloud.gcp.credentials.location` property and, instead, let the Spring Cloud GCP Core
Starter find the correct credentials for those environments.
