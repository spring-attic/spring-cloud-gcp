= Spring Boot Starter for Google Stackdriver Trace

Maven coordinates, using Spring Cloud GCP BOM:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-cloud-gcp-starter-trace</artifactId>
</dependency>
----

Gradle coordinates:

[source]
----
dependencies {
    compile group: 'org.springframework.cloud', name: 'spring-cloud-gcp-starter-trace', version: '1.0.0.BUILD-SNAPSHOT'
}
----

This starter uses Spring Cloud Sleuth and provides a `SpanReporter` that sends the Sleuth's trace information to Stackdriver Trace.

All configurations are optional. You can override a number of default configuration values in addition to the core
`spring.cloud.gcp.project-id` and `spring.cloud.gcp.credentials.location`.

By default, this starter will send trace asynchronously using a flushable trace consumer that auto-flushes when
its buffered trace messages exceed its buffer size or have been buffered for longer than its scheduled delay.

The following properties are optional:

----
# Number of threads to use by the underlying gRPC channel to send the trace request to Stackdriver
spring.cloud.gcp.trace.executor-threads=[NUMBER_OF_SENDER_THREADS]

# Buffer size, defaults to 1% of Runtime.totalMemory(), traces will be flushed to Stackdriver when buffered trace
# messages exceed this size.
spring.cloud.gcp.trace.buffer-size-bytes=[BUFFER_SIZE_BYTES]

# Buffered trace messages will be flushed to Stackdriver when buffered longer than scheduled delays (in seconds).
# Default is 10 seconds
spring.cloud.gcp.trace.scheduled-delay-seconds=[SCHEDULED_DELAY_SECONDS]

# GCP project ID Trace is served from
spring.cloud.gcp.trace.project-id=[TRACE_GCP_PROJECT_ID]

# Credentials for the trace service
spring.cloud.gcp.trace.credentials.location=[CREDENTIALS_FILESYSTEM_LOCATION]
spring.cloud.gcp.trace.credentials.scope=[COMMA_DELIMITED_SCOPE_LIST]
----

You can use core Spring Cloud Sleuth properties to control Sleuth's sampling rate, etc.
Read https://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-sleuth/[Sleuth documentation] for more information
on Sleuth configurations.

For example, when you are testing to see the traces are going through, you can set the sampling rate to 100%.

----
spring.sleuth.sampler.percentage=1                              # Send 100% of the request traces to Stackdriver.
spring.sleuth.web.skipPattern=(^cleanup.*|.+favicon.*)          # Ignore some URL paths
----

Stackdriver Trace requires the use of 128-bit Trace ID. This starter ignores `spring.sleuth.traceId128` property
and it'll always uses 128-bit Trace ID.

== Enable APIs
You must enable Stackdriver Trace API from the Google Cloud Console in order to capture traces.
Navigate to the link:https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/api/cloudtrace.googleapis.com/overview[Stackdriver Trace API]
for your project and make sure it's enabled.
